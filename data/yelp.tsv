1	Flat Iron Steak was prepared very well , delivered Medium Rare exactly . Exemplary service and friendly staff . My iced tea glass was refilled regularly . Nothing to complain about here . Good chain restaurant with predictably good quality and predictably good service .	
1	Already LOVE the doughnuts ... . . but when they were out of what I wanted , and gave it to me free when it was ready , they had my heart ! Way to go on excellent customer service ! ! !	
0	Complete lack of respect for peoples time . Dirty office and a staff that has even less respect for their patients ! Don 't waste your time waiting here you 'll spend less time waiting and get better care in an er ! . I have been waiting 1hr and 30 mins past my 2nd appointment . Dr didn 't even know why I was there !	
1	One of my favorite restaurants in charlotte . I come here all the time . The view from the patio is peaceful and overlooking charlotte 's skyline . Their food is good . I love their Caesar salad and don 't forget to add salmon !	
1	My mom loves this place as she loves the Coca - Cola brand who somehow transformed their soda company into an entertainment company with merchandise . Kudos . That being said , this is a very fun , family - friendly , thing to do on the strip . There is a polar bear , soda tastings and of course merchandise ! Love this place !	
0	The spice market buffet is not the best . I 'm not sure how they are # 1 as they claim . It is average at best . Food is okay . I was only there for lunch . So lunch sucks . Maybe dinner is better .	
1	Jaime was really cool and helpful . She was knowledgeable about fabrics and what would work best for my needs . Jaime was also honest about length of time it took to get things in . It 's a solid place to look bridesmaid dresses .	
1	We went on a Saturday afternoon , the decor was inviting . The staff wasn 't as friendly as some places we have been . However , they were not rude or anything . Just not overly friendly . The Rolls are good sized portions and the sauces are really yummy . Food overall was great ! ! ! ! ! !	
1	we came here because of a groupon deal , but it was a good atmosphere , good service , good fish and chips , good drinks . can 't go wrong . too bad it 's so far away !	
0	We did not have a good experience here . The food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low . The server was slow and when we got the food to go sauce leaked out if the bag creating a massive mess . The containers just weren 't able to hold all that bland flavor . If a one star rating doesn 't tell you to skip it , I don 't know what will .	
1	I 've found a great new happy hour ( 3 - 6pm ) location in Hussong 's Cantina . $ 3 draft beers - including imports . Most other happy hours in Madalay Bay / Luxor seem to discount just PBR or Bud Light . Food was also a hit including the free homemade tortilla chips and salsa as well as a half - price steak quesadilla that was big enough for two .	
1	Came here out of the blue on Sunday Morning . And what a great breakfast location . I love the open kitchen , the staff and most importantly the Eggs Benedict . Great atmosphere and very cool art on the walls . Highly recommend .	
0	Decided to try this place again hoping the lady had a bad day prior . Guess what same RUDE service as the last time ! Plus it 's so hot in here with no air conditioning ! Worth driving up to the W . Charleston location . No wonder we were the only ones there ! !	
1	Love the taro yogurt and mochi balls ! The only down side is the lack of seating and the fifty bajillion college kids that swarm this place . Maybe that 's just the old woman in me , but this place gets really loud ! I definitely like it here better than Mojo 's so I 'll take my yogurt to go and enjoy it in peace !	
1	I absolutely LOVE this place . Every meal that my husband and I have ordered here has been excellent ! They serve only the freshest seafood you could ask for , cooked to perfection ! I recommend the Seafood Market & Restaurant over Red Lobster any day !	
0	I went to ghost bar with my wife recently and will never set foot in the place again ! The bar itself does not live up to the hype it gets . The experience was bad from the start with the guy working the entrance before you enter the elevators . He was extremely rude and had absolutely no manners . Never again , plenty of other places in Vegas to go ! !	
1	My hubby and I were first timers to this place and it won 't be the last time . The complementary chips and salsa and been dip is very yummy . We irdered chicken fajitas and they quick to the table and very good . Our waters were never empty the service was great . We had a server named John and he was so dedicated about his work and you could tell . Super friendly and attentitive !	
1	XO Chinese food is awesome . For take out , i cant recommend a better place . My personel favorite dish is the pineapple shrimp fried rice . Prices are great and they deliver fast . Thumbs up to XO !	
0	Stay away from the Sirloin dishes . I don 't know what the heck is in this - it tastes like compacted beef , shred up and repackaged to look like a steak ... . . not I 'd even say the sirloin was nuked after reading these reviews . Disgusting !	
0	Not very fresh . Rice was hard . Beans crusted over . Taste was ok . Maybe it was a bad nite but the service was also uninspired . With many other burrito options no reason to come here .	
1	I had a facial with the lovely Katia and let me just say that she is amazing ! Very detail oriented and knowledgable . I left her shop feeling elated and my skin looks amazing ! I will definitely recommend her and can 't wait to come back to Las Vega s and doing my facial , sugaring and makeup with Katia again .	
1	Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting . The gift shop is one of the best in the city . They feature crafts from artists around the world and local . Shows are well lit and well presented . Downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals , wood , fiber , mixed media and book / paper arts ( beginning to advanced ) . They do a great job of hosting outside events and fundraisers .	
1	I am completely in love with their herb bread . It 's a tasty sourdough loaf filled with fresh herbs , but not so herby it can 't handle sweet applications . It 's great toasted and topped with cranberry goat cheese . At $ 8 a loaf I don 't buy it often , but it is a favorite treat .	
0	Bahn MI was just O . K . , Pho again was just O . K . I don 't get it they have great reviews . Please help us fid great Pho , Bahn Mi , & Ramen in the greater PHX area .	
1	Awesome tortillas , awesome salsa , pretty good selection of Latin American food products ( mostly Mexican , but lots of S . /Central American and Caribbean ) . I 'm spoiled from all the Hispanic grocery stores in Atlanta , but this is the best one I 've found in the ' burgh . Prices are average for the Strip and Pittsburgh , but a little high for a Hispanic grocery store .	
1	Very nice club . I had a friend who worked here so he got us in for free . Good people , good air ventilation and fun music . The crowd is more decent than most clubs which MIGHT translate until the people not being as slutty . If you love random - people-dancing , this place is slightly harder . Still a cool club regardless .	
1	A tad pricey , but the quality of food is worth it . The steak kabob was tender and cooked perfectly medium rare . However , the ground meat kabob such as the ground chicken kabob , you get twice as much meat for the price , but the spices that are used are good .	
1	This place is so good ! I 'm half mexican , but don 't enjoy mexican food as much as you would think . This place has made me change my mind . The street corn is great ! The portion sizes are big and I 'm always satisfied when I walk out . My favorite is the shrimp plate with the rice and beans . Their juices are to die for !	
1	Great place to enjoy a cocktail ( bellini for me ) and escape the noise of the casino ! It is a classy bar with comfortable seating and friendly servers . It 's pricey , but isn 't everything in Vegas these days ?	
1	I heart Defalcos . The sandwhiches are always good and yesterday I had a bite of a friends pasta and it was delish . I have also purchased things from the store and they are always amazing . Four stars only because sometimes the wait is ridiculous .	
1	Great food & service . Bridget is the BEST waitress ! A group of us go here for lunch about once a month and she knew our orders by heart after our 2nd visit . Would highly recommend the topopo salad and the lunch buffet .	
1	Seriously great ball park . We had great seats 3 rows back halfway between home & 1st , but i dont think there is a bad seat in this park . Amazing view over the river & the downtown area of Pittsburgh ... ... ... . & of course the Red Sox won ! !	
1	The food at this chain has always been consistently good . Our server in downtown ( where we spent New Year ' s ) was new , but that did not impact our service at all . She was prompt and attentive to our needs .	
1	The absolute best damn burger I have ever had anywhere ever . 5 stars for the burger ! The service is excellent 4 stars . The atmosphere is fun and open with spacious high tops throughout . 4 stars . The fresh cut fries are delicious . 4 stars . Late hours - open ' till 12am on Friday & Saturday nights - Yay ! 4 stars .	
0	Update : This Winchells that I reviewed on N . Decatur has now closed and is now Dulce Donuts . I hope to go over to Dulce Donuts soon and try them . ( the two stars are for the Winchells that was here . I just wanted to update so everyone knows that it is now closed )	
0	We stayed at the Phoenician and had the opportunity to dine at Il Terrrazzo for breakfast . It would have been a lovely experience if it was not for the fact that the host was overly pretentious and the lady at the bar wasn 't able to handle more than 4 customers at a time . It 's unfortunate that a beautiful property like the Phoenician doesn 't prioritize employing more competent hospitable people .	
1	its more than a casino and hotel . they have shops and restaurants inside , and club pure . serendipity is conveniently located right outside the building , so you can go downstairs and get some frozen hot chocolate ! the hotel is really nice inside ; very spacious and classy looking . they have very comfortable mattresses and pillows so its easy to fall asleep and not miss home ! pool area looks pretty too .	
0	Definitely a misleading store . You will find no great deals and no low prices . I don 't know how they can have such outrageous prices and expect to do much business in Arizona Mills Mall . The staff seem clueless and unmotivated .	
0	Ppl were ranting about the All natural burgers - they are frozen patties . There was a long line of customers upset at the fact the food took forever . 20 min wait just for ice cream . The kicker of the whole experience was the 6 dollar burger that looks like it came from In and Out . Place is ridiculous . Wont last .	
1	Our driver was excellent and especially helpful to an elderly lady who was returning to Mesa , AZ for the winter . He carried her bags to her front door and helped her with a cranky front door lock . He was very kind to her .	
1	The food here was good and unique ! I would recommend slightly dressing up ... like with slacks and a nicer shirt / top . I went in a t - shirt , capris , and flip - flops and felt under - dressed .	
0	Honestly disappointed with the service . They require additional deposit on cash or debit card ( ? ! ) payments , $ 50 per night ! The hallways are noisy , you can hear everything from adjoining rooms . Breakfast is $ 14 per person , kind of ridiculous because there are virtually no restaurants in the area . Go elsewhere in a cooler neighborhood if you 're staying here for fun .	
1	As a Chicagoan who grew up eating at Lawry 's the Vegas location does not disappoint ! The service is 1st class , the food is absolutely delicious ! The room has an old supper club elegance . The organization that I enjoy hosts their regular luncheons at Lawry 's and I couldn 't be happier !	
1	Hipster service can be a frightening thought but the kids at The Crepe Bar must be majoring in culinary services . The atmosphere is laid back but there is nothing lazy about the quality of food and service . This isn 't the regular chain style breakfast joint , as soon as the food arrives you can see it in the plating and most importantly , taste it .	
1	Definitely a pool party to come too if in Vegas and want to have some fun in the water . The crowd is young and fun it 's full of energy . Music is great and the bartenders are good and quick . Regular drinks are $ 16 . 00 and the bigger ones are $ 32 . 00 . There 's lockers that you can rent for $ 40 . 00 .	
0	Overpriced , Americanized , Asian style food . Although advertised as a noodle and dim sum restaurant the menu contains food from all over the place with little dim sum offerings . Everything is overpriced for what it is . The service was fine and the atmosphere was nice as well . But the food was not worth it .	
0	First , their clothing is arranged by color , not by size . While thrift stores may think this looks great , it 's not great for people shopping for one size . Also , their prices were outrageous . Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more . The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store . We won 't be back to this one .	
1	Went on a whim and tried a place I 've never heard of or even been to . Tried my YELP app and found this place and was really impressed the food was delicious . I had the Salisbury steak w/ mash potatoes & gravy , green beans and a roll . Pretty good portion . I would recommend this place . I definitely will come back if I 'm in the area .	
1	Great cheap homemade Chinese comfort food ... Very easy to get to and the owners there are very nice to everyone . They talk with you see how your days are and make sure everything is good in your life . Overall service was excellent , it 's right off the light - rail stop too in Mesa !	
0	Ok , I know it 's Vegas and everything is expensive , but these were just mediocre over priced deli sandwiches and small soggy potato pancakes . However , as in most casino spots , the staff trips over themselves to make sure that you have everything that you need and that you aren 't waiting for good service .	
1	Fastest lunch ever . Great vegan options . Friendly service . I wish my wife liked Chines because it would definitely be a dinner option . For now , it 's my quickie lunches at the bar . Fried rice and crispy tofu !	
0	Very rude people . My son picked up a snow globe which then broke in his hand . The assistant manager then asked to pay and refused to write an incident report . Didn 't care that we had glass on him .	
0	Came here last Saturday after the Color Run . There was no line and now I know why . The food was awful , the portions were small , and the employees were talking about the customers in Spanish ( I know because I 'm fluent ) ! I 'd give this place negative stars if I could . Needless to say , I will NOT be back .	
1	Just awesome . Professional crew . Dave and Kevin are great . I love the games . One day Joust will work ! ! Just found Spectrum , my new favorite game . Its PAPA , the crown champ of Pinball Tournaments .	
1	Took them yesterday on a one way trip from Surprise . The professional driver was early for the appointment -- I liked that a lot . Van was nice , clean and the temp was good . It ended up a great choice --- we were really impressed . This city is kinda big and the airport complex . Glad we gave them a try .	
0	Extremely dirty dirty dirty arcade ... Enough said ... I 've never seen such filth inside a place as this . . Gum on controllers of machines , spilled food and drink all over machines , water and spills on floors causing people to trip ... . I couldn 't get out of here fast enough . Yuck .	
0	the worse place I have ever been to . It is located inside a run down gas station . The place has a feel of Texas chainsaw massacre . Inside , the place was equally horrific as the outside . There is no way I would send my dog there ever again .	
0	Yesterday we wait over 25 min for the food . When we ask the manager she say : I 'm taking care of it right away . 10 min later we decided to leave and the manager say : I don 't want to serve you ... . We visit this restaurant many times but they will NOT see us again for long time PS : the restaurant was almost empty	
1	The food was pretty good , but come armed with lots of patience , because they are very slow to fill your order . The price was right and one full star goes to the cute friendly waiter that gave us a hug , Cheers !	
0	I 've been here 3 times , and each time we were told sorry , the kitchen 's backed up as an excuse for the slow and confused service . The first time , the fries and hot appetizers came out cold . The burgers are okay but not worth having to endure the frustration of dining here . If you do end up here , get the cheeseburger and a shake . And good luck .	
1	My wife and I loved this place . Fried chicken , awesome . Rice , lobster asparagus and black truffle , to die for . Suzie , the server , new the answer to everything . Managers all working the room . Talking to , and helping with service . Don 't miss the Ginger bread Pudding for dessert . Good stuff here .	
1	Ate there Saturday Sept 27th staying across the street in spring hill suites we wanted something to eat and the buffalo pierogies were awesome , wife had pull pork sandwich which she liked and I had sloppy joe sandwich and was very good . We both had loaded tots was amazing ... . Glad we stopped in to eat during our visit	
1	We had dinner with about 26 people from our West Valley Meetup Group . In a private room , the food was excellent , the service was outstanding , the wait staff was so accommodating to all of us . We will hold future events here and I will visit them more often as it had been a while .	
0	These guys are Wow , we found a vehicle which was great an it needed to be looked at they said it would be an they would call us . . they next day we drive by it 's back on the lot an No call . Really how big of a liar can you be ... No call was made an I 'm sure No repair ... such bullshit if I 've ever seen ! . .	
1	This place is fantastic . I 've tried the shrimp skewers with forbidden rice and the beet salad and been very satisfied both times . The wife is a very picky , difficult vegetarian and she loves this place . High praise !	
1	The Mill and Baseline location is excellent . Service is fast and friendly , prices are reasonable and portions generous . Their veggie burro is excellent with big fresh chunks of avacodo , mm hmm . Their chips and salsa are also better than most casual taco shops . You can order ahead and pick up at the take out windows .	
1	Great place . The staff was very friendly and attentive . The food was great . The sandwiches were huge . The butchers block . Great selection of charcuterie and cheese . The goat cheese was awesome . We also got the bruschetta , the first four in the menu . Everything was delicious .	
1	I loved Zeke 's Hot Yoga classes . He has a great personality -- I wonder where he 's teaching now ? April 2007 Update : I MISS THIS PLACE SOOOO MUCH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! You can 't find a better instructor than Sascha . I really miss her hot yoga class . It 's transcendental .	
1	Ive walked by this joint a few times as i drunken walk towards the center of the strip ... So finally decided to walk in the waitress was very nice ( dont remember her name ) long story short happy hour $ 4 - 32 oz domestic beer , happy hour nachos feeds 2 were good would definetly go back	
0	Oh for the love of God this place is boring . Pottery and pictures of pottery . I came here for some tour a few years ago . I was so bored I went outside and took a nap next to giant flower pot . Then I came back here last month for a charity event and also took a nap , this time in the bathroom . Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ...	
0	terrible service ; pay with debit card and get an attitude plus an additional $ 1 for the privilege . Typical service of a business that couldn 't care less , and think THEY are doing YOU the favor . Do YOURSELF a favor and go somewhere they actually value their customers . Here they DO NOT ! !	
0	Worst DD I 've ever been to . Today I tried to use a gift card . I was told that their machine didn 't work and wouldn 't accept it . I asked if I could have a coffee . They said only if I had cash which I did not have . So no coffee . Will never go there again . I 'm only giving this one star because zero stars is not an option .	
0	I 'm confused by all the high ratings . I 've had plenty of good Mexican while in and around Phoenix but this was definitely on the low end . I did find out after from some locals this is more the end of night drunk food stop . Eh well .	
1	Unfortunately has closed it 's doors . Bummer because I heard so much about the awesome taste and had a hankering for some cake . Maybe next time . The four stars I 'm giving it are for those who 've told me how good the cupcakes are .	
0	Here for the weekend and was told i had to try this place out . The Pittsburger cheese steak was pretty bland . Unseasoned beef , dry fries , mediocre slaw , and white bread . Hopefully Pittsburgh has some better must eat places .	
0	Fries were cold and greasy and flavorless . Hamburgers okay , not over the top like we were expecting . Got our drinks after we got our burgers . We left thinking Bobby would be pissed if he would have had the meal we had at his place !	
0	for starters the place is the same as before , it 's still to bright , food fare , beer selection fare , bad decor same place different sign we felt the food was the same as eating at Eat - n-Park fish was over cooked , & just a plain , bland chicken salad but the tomatoes were fresh In this case a change in the name didn 't change restaurant	
1	I came here as a nervous newly engaged girl . Tiffany helped me to pick out the dresses I wanted and then recommended some that I might like . Even if I don 't buy my dress there , I would recommend it to anyone in the wedding party .	
1	What a wonderful evening to start out with happy hour and mike I or ( my guy ) excellent food from grilled shrimp to creme burlee fun friend , tequila ... Had a great time mike was on top of it at least we were one of few customers on the patio .	
1	Great place to eat . We did order quite a few dishes - Mussels , crab cakes , dip , scallops , steak and chocolate mousse . Mussels by far was the best . Steak was not the best as it was over cooked . Will definitely go back . I am sure the outside sitting in summer would be great .	
1	Customer service is great . Lots of different juices from different companies . I personally love the crowns reserve barons brew . I drive across town just to go here . I broke one of my mechanical mods and he replaced it with no problems . I will definitely be going back .	
0	Packed up the kids and headed down to try a new pizzeria . Called in the afternoon they said they would be open until 10 PM . Pulled up at 7 PM and they said sorry we are closed .	
0	The worst tasting filipino food ive ever tasted in my life . Food was cold and wasnt fresh . rice smelled funny . best to say filipino food is better cooked at home . The 2 reasons why it didnt get 1 star is 1 . Its on the strip and 2 . only pinoy spot . on the strip .	
0	This hotel smells awful . It 's a mixture of cigarette smoke and coconuts . It 's overwhelming . It gets on your clothes and on your skin . I had a reservation for 4 nights , but I moved out after spending just 1 night . I had to wash all my clothes .	
1	Pizza was on point ! Chewy crust , fresh mozzarella and delicious topping ! Sausage & mushroom and vingole will not disappoint . Manager stopped by the table to personally thank us and check in which was a nice touch . Good atmosphere , a nice addition to the Arcadia neighborhood- I will be back ! !	
1	Growing up one of my good friends parents ' were from Venezuela and his mom used to make us arepas . It had been many years since I had had one of these great meals because I didn 't know where to find them , so when I discovered this place I was elated . I usually get the chicken as well as the bean , add avocado , you wont be disappointed !	
0	Way too many breeder bitches clogging the place up on Saturday nights all dressed up like bimbos . More vaginas than hot men dancing shirtless . It 's turning into a straight bar . I stand a better chance of finding a C**k to suck at Dos Gringos .	
1	This place is awesome . I shop here more than any other store in the area . fantastic selection of new and used music and video . Cool collectable stuff ... a great place for gift shopping ! The staff rocks ... I love this pace !	
1	Love this place ! ! You don 't even have to know how to paint = D The staff is amazing , especially Rachel ! She always accommodates my request . Love their cocoanut balls Mmm yum yum . With all that said if you need to relieve some stress , have some fun or both ... try Design & Wine ! !	
0	well i just called to place a to - go order and was turned away because they stop taking orders at 8 : 30 , even though i called right on the dot ... . they dont close for another half hour ... THAT already put a bad taste in my mouth . . so much for a new place in the area ... THANKS BUT NO THANK !	
0	They are open 24hours that 's about all they have going for them . The prices are outrageous and they nickel and dime you for everything . To use the credit card there is a 75cents charge . A half of pint of Malibu Rum was 17 . 99 ! ! ! Outrageous !	
1	Pizzeria Bianco is definitely one of the premier pizza place in Arizona . I 've been there a few times now , and I would say it 's worth it every time ! I have a friend who goes there frequently for her birthday , and I 'm happy to tag along !	
0	This morning I give one star . I find it unacceptable to be waiting in the drive thru line with nobody else there at 6 : 03 in the morning having to wait 3 minutes for my order to be taken . That 's unacceptable . Usually I am in an out of the drive thru very quickly however this just irritated me this morning when I 'm in a hurry to get to work .	
0	$ 9 for 1 damn scoop of ice cream ! ! ! ! ! ! I stopped here to get one scoop of icecream in a cone and they charged me $ 8 . 58 ! ! ! I know this is Vegas but damn ! The scoop was average size and it didn 't even taste that good . Never again ! ! ! ! ! !	
1	Just terrific . Time and again . Every dish bursts with flavor and the chicken tika comes out sizzling with a great seasoned crust to it , unlike other places where it 's only unadorned skewered chunks of unseasoned chicken . If they created a bit more ambience - maybe music ? - and worked on the patio decor they would be a 5 star in my book . I 'm hooked .	
0	Ordered for delivery and was told it would take 45 mins . I called them an hour and fifteen in and was told they should be there any minute . A half hour later I finally got what I ordered An hour and 45 mins , that 's how long it took to receive my stone cold falafels . This was my first time ordering with them and probably my last	
0	Pizza was not that good . Beer selection was weak at best . The vibe of the place was really bad compared to what it was just after being outside . Waitress even seemed depressed . Wont eat here again and definitely wouldn 't go out of ny way to eat here ... Good concept gone bad and poorly executed .	
1	Good experience . Entrance to restaurant was confusing but was beautiful . Even though they make their own beers , offer wine but NO liquor : ( Tea was ok . Pretzel w / beer cheese like other places . Burger was great ! Tasty & juicy ! Salmon pita was great too ! Wait staff helpful and always checking on us .	
1	this is some first rate mexican food . everything from the tortillas to the beans are fantastico here ... . and the prices are great as well ... if you are ever in the area and craving some good mexican food look no further .	
1	$ 3 . 95 NY steak and eggs with hash browns ! from 12am - 6am only It was a good steak for the price ... sooo cheap ! The mozarella sticks are kinda pricey and the red clam chowder was sour . THIS PLACE IS WORTH A TRY FOR THE $ 3 . 95 STEAK ! DEFINITELY WILL GO BACK TO TAKE MY PARENTS .	
0	Holy cinnamon all up in your face ! Cinna - cones , cinna - brooms , cinna - wreaths , cinna - scents galore ! Everything smells like cinnamon and I hate the smell of cinnamon ! I even smelled like cinnamon a day after going into the store . I burped and guess what it smelled like ? CINNAMON ! Happy Holidays	
1	This Mex restaurant is tucked away in a corner of a dark parking lot . The inside is nicely decorated with clay tiled comfortable booths I had the arroz and pollo and it was delicious . See my picture . I added a $ 4 . 25 margarita . It was a nice size with a good mix of alcohol and flavor . The staff was friendly and good . I 'd stop here again if in the area .	
1	Great place to watch football , they have tons of tv 's everywhere ! They have a great deal for domestic pitchers $ 6 . 75 ! There food and service is really good too . However , it is hard to get good cell phone service in there , so that 's a little disappointing .	
1	great cheap gas station ! ! I 'm always putting in gas for my road trips downtown ! : ) they even have cones that separate lines so that cars don 't get into crazy turning accidents after gassing up ! It 's so useful for Costcos to have all these things in one place ! I don 't put gas anywhere else : )	
0	Very disappointing . We should 've known by the yelp reviews , but figured we 'd give it a try anyways . The TV in our booth was nice , but not enough to compensate for the bland , over cooked food and server with an attitude . Sidelines of Chandler was NOTHING like our beloved Sidelines of Brunswick Ohio ! Will not be back .	
0	Wtf happened ? ? ? ? ? ? The don 't do the check in offers anymore . They don 't have internet to use credit cards . They don 't have icecream to make shakes . I guess the fastest way to drive a business to the ground is to have crappy management , crappy business plan . At least the fries and the yaya were still good .	
1	Great sushi buffet ! The sushi is fresh and the service is great . Nice ambience too . Love the spicy tuna salad - yum ! The bacon wrapped scallop is so yummy too ! All their rolls r fabulous ! Would highly recommend it . This is now my regular spot whenever I 'm in Vegas .	
1	I love this place so much . It is by far the best all - you-can - eat sushi that I have found . Everytime I am in Vegas I make sure I hit this place up at least once . They always have very fresh fish and since it is a full menu made to order all - you-can - eat you can be happy ordering the nicer stuff and not worry about breaking the wallet .	
1	Amazing , authentic Mexican food ! The papa loca and the stuffed quesadillas are my favorite , both the carne asada and chicken are delicious ! The little taqueria is very clean and bright . The food is of great quality yet not expensive ! Always great service and helpful staff .	
0	Tried Atlanta Bread Company for the first ( and last ) time this week . Food was very mediocre . Fillings of sandwiches were fine , but the bread tasted stale . To be named Atlanta BREAD Company and not have bread that knocks your socks off is ridiculous . Not to mention the unfriendly manager and a front door that wouldn 't open properly . Overall , not a good experience .	
1	Just had lunch here on a Saturday during bowl week . It was busy . Wound up eating the elk burger and the beer sampler . We also ate the calamari as an appetizer . It was all pretty good . I don 't know if it was because the Sun Bowl was on , but it was quite busy with a long wait on a Saturday afternoon .	
1	SUPERB job fixing my insanely cracked screen ! FANTASTIC customer service ! VERY FRIENDLY ! They even put on a free screen protector & gave me a free case : ) Desert Wireless is the place to go to ! ! BIG THUMBS UP GUYS ! ! !	
0	This review is for the nachos . Wow they are salty and terrible . The poor cook painstakingly put meat , tomatoes and cheese on individual chips and put them under the broiler . Their hard work was wasted as I just wanted chips with toppings piled on with cheese all over the place . Plus it was incredibly salty .	
1	SO Good ! Homemade AND absolutely yummy . Affordable , generous portions . Deserts are also out of this world . Can 't go wrong between this and other restaurants in this shopping center . Best to go on weekdays to avoid crowds . I 'll be frequenting this place often ! I 'm from Boston and thought this tops many of the restaurants , there . That 's quite a compliment .	
0	I was pretty disappointed for a Las Vegas Starbucks to be so behind on the standard of the Starbucks trademark . They didn 't have the drinks for the rewards secret menu , didn 't have a rewards scanner , and didn 't offer the ' short ' size option . And everything was overpriced ... But the coffee still hit the spot .	
1	Great food . I had the hooley kebab for dinner . It was on the lunch menu but they still let me order it . Huge portion . Tasted my dads lamb stew and loved it ! It was trivia night so winning 50 bones certainly helped w that 5th star ; )	
0	Looked interesting and so we decided to hit it up with a bunch of friends . Saw the rave reviews on Yelp and sure enough -- it was good . But it 's just cheese in a pastry . Nothing special . They 're pretty small too . I paid 13 $ for two cheese in pastries . But hey , it seemed authentic and the owners were friendly . Really , I just expected more .	
0	Today at legacy urgent care I was appalled by the behavior of the front seat lady . She was rude to me and my mother . My mom called to pay my deductible , she slammed the phone down on her and she cursed under her breathe . Her name is Elizabeth . I have never been treated so horribly here , but she has always been a little rude , today just went too far .	
0	Poor service , indifferently cleaned food , and weak seasoning . The menu also didn 't match the food actually served , so I got to eat pork for the first time since my conversion 20 years ago . They were FAR from apologetic . We will not be back .	
1	Great place for BBQ in Anthem . When you get a chance try their creation called the Hog Dog , don 't be scared it 's not as spicy as the description may imply . The Ribs are better than average , the fried macaroni and cheese lacks flavor . As for everything else on the menu , it 's great . I can say that because I have tasted the whole menu already .	
1	The other reviews are right on . This place is so weird and sketchy I would never send my wife here . The inside looks like a great place to get murdered . I prefer to sit outside thinking about which direction I 'd run if shit goes down . But the people are nice and they do a thorough job on the car for a good price . BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE CASH !	
0	Expensive . I was charged close to ten bucks for a bean burrito and a carne asada . Really ? Taco Bell is next door ! The food was just okay . Very skimpy with the meat , and it felt like I was eating plain tortilla . Heads up - drive through takes a minute . It 's fresh though . Don 't think I 'd be back .	
0	The management is terrible and the owner is rude and unaccomodating . . not really authentic Filipino food . . just authentic Filipino workers ... i prefer to go to Barkada 's on Decatur and Sahara ... main chef now works there , way better and atmosphere is always great	
1	Food ? What food ? This is a good place to relax and have a drink , or nine . Its just a tavern . A Central Wisconsin tavern . Its not fancy . The bar tenders are friendly , the drinks are strong , what else can one want ?	
0	No stars for me where did all the good employee 's go out of no where . . sorry you guys lost a loyal customer . Rude , manger took forever to help me with my concerns . Dont even know her name , someone needs to take this store over or bring back the old workers .	
1	Loved it ! Many places don 't give you that much fish and a lot of rice in their rolls , but the ratio of fish - to-rice was perfect ! A great balance . Flavors were some of the best we 've had in the valley . We recommend Cherry Blossom . Definitely will be returning	
1	The food here is so damn good . The bacon jam is good on almost anything . The sliders have so much flavor . The donut bread - pudding was sinfully delicious . You meet cool people here . It doesn 't appear to seat a lot so I recommend a reservation for weekends . I wish they had a bigger menu because the flavors are WOW .	
1	If you are looking for a restaurant in north Scottsdale , with a good atmosphere and even better food . Look no further than here . The staff is amazing and the food is all local . You can just taste the freshness , you can also wash it down with a tasty beverage as they have a full selection of beer and wine ! I highly recommend giving this place a try !	
0	The food was very overpriced , especially for a tapas bar . The sardines were not very good , and difficult to pick through all the bones . Also , I 'd like to see more vegetarian options on the menu .	
1	It smells nice . It 's inexpensive . It makes a sly dig at the recipient 's personal hygiene . And this is yet another place where you can pick up gifts for any menopausal women who make it onto your Xmas gift - buying list .	
1	Good food and great service . Of course , if you 're staying in the camelback you 'll most definitely have already been here . Warning , there is no Sunday brunch in the summer months ! I recommend the tortilla soup , and don 't get the soupy , salty enchiladas !	
0	after purchasing a groupon online i scheduled an appointment to get my photo - shoot , and day of I could not make it and Adam was very rude and told me that I was basically out the money payed for the shoot , very unprofessional and I would choose someone with more class .	
1	This location has lots of goodies for the fanboy types with its floor to ceiling memorabilia for Beatles , Elvis , Kiss , Jimi Hendrix and most other popular bands . One of sin city 's best kept secrets .	
0	Blow it out . The party 's over . This candle has flickered and the flame has gone out . Wax on . Wax off . Closed . And for anyone who caught my stand up , yes indeed , I have purchased tapered candles here .	
1	I went to Zuma Grill for lunch , and it was awesome ! I have very high standards for green chile , since I am from New Mexico , and their green chile pork stew was great . I also had their bacon cheese burger with green chile . I highly recommend eating there . In fact , I signed up for Yelp specifically so I could write a review on the delicious food offered at Zuma Grill .	
1	This place is tiny and has more high - end expensive beads than other stores in Phoenix . I 've found some really special items here . You shouldn 't expect to buy more than a few strands at a time , as it just isn 't affordable . Go somewhere else for quantity , and just get a few things to spice up your mix from Bead World .	
0	The store was absolutely filthy and the staff was rude . One would expect management to be polite , but the man I spoke to was even worse than the cashier , he was short with me and questioned my reasons for seeking the product I was in a condescending manner .	
0	Food is adequate to satisfy the appetite . Served cafeteria - style . I had the pancit and lechon . My mother makes way better pancit , and the lechon was either dry or had to much fat on it . Food is mediocre at best .	
1	Good food , good service and great game . Being from Boston I am a little bias towards a bar that let 's me watch the Sox game when I am 1000 miles from home . At first we where dissapointed in the lack of interest in the game , but by the end there was a decent amount of the crowd following the game .	
1	The pizza is very good , especially the BBQ pizza . We live very close so it works out perfect . They make the pizza pretty old school and the guys that work there a cool . I recommend it to anyone .	
1	Went for breakfast early one morning . Sat at the bar and had excellent service and who doesn 't love an omelette with bacon and brie ? The breakfast was amazing and I 'm already looking forward to my next meal there .	
0	I normally order delivery for lunch with no issues . However today , my meal was around $ 9 bucks ... . I gave the delivery guy $ 20 and got $ 3 bucks back ... Umm . . Tip ? Dine in or Go to Skinny Fats down the street	
1	Outstanding ! I was in Scottsdale for some golf and baseball . Threw my back out and was suffering . Looked like my weekend was ruined but I happened to find Thai Royal . Tara ( sorry if name is misspelled ) was a miracle worker . She worked on stretching my back and I was 100 % better . Looks like I 'll be golfing tomorrow : ) Thank you Tara and Thai Royal Massage !	
1	Amazing . Customer service is the best and I will be returning for gift baskets each time I have a need . I was surprised that they give you such large samples of their bread . And it was delicious . The baskets hey custom made for us were affordable and very professional . Good job guys .	
0	This chain hurts my stomach after I eat it . I don 't like how they man handle your food in the assembly line . I don 't like how fatty the chicken is . There are hundreds of authentic taco shops to get your food from that kick the snot out of this place . Thumbs down , full boycott .	
0	The location is convenient but I was not a fan of the food . I had shrimp and Chinese veggies and crab Rangoon . They cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland . I won 't go back for food but the crab Rangoon was ok . They didn 't give any sauce . You have to ask for it . That sucks .	
0	Cheap drinks but the bar and scene is very ghetto for being in Gilbert . They have a stage with old big screen tvs on it when it can be used for entertainment . All the other tvs are over 10 years old . Did I also mention the homeless man hanging out the the smokers area ... . terrible food bad service but hey you definetly get what you pay for .	
1	Whenever my husband and I do shows , we stop here first . They have a great selection of shows as well as restaurants . We have gotten tickets to popular shows for next to nothing . I would definitely recommend stopping in and seeing what they have before heading to the box office .	
0	Wait time for table : Perfect , no wait . Hostess : Raven , awesome . Bread : Yummy . Servers : Friendly , forgetful . Never saw a manager to back them up out front . Speed of service : Slow . Taste of food : Didn 't really matter , lost appetite . Would go back : No .	
0	There 's one thing that sums up this restaurant ... On the menu , there is an item called Free Range Veal . Huh ? Everyone at our table questioned that . Sounded more like marketing hype . So of course , the waiter made up some incomprehensible , illogical B . S . explanation . It went downward from there . It was one of the more forgettable dining experiences I 've had on the Strip .	
0	Congratulations to the Democratic party for being so divided that they can 't even agree on a candidate to be considered for the general election . Nice job fellas . You 're pushing a candidate who didn 't even get a clear majority of YOUR party 's votes lol . What 's one half of one half ? A quarter of the whole ? Why don 't you just give McCain the keys to the White House already .	
1	Tried their chicken pho & a sandwich the server recommended and everything was delicious . I was pretty hungover and it brought me back to life . The customer service was good too and it 's at a pretty good location .	
0	Very disappointed with amount they assigned to goods was so shocked I literally did not refuse payment but went back to make sure they had given full credit , still don 't believe they did check all items . Will never consign there again .	
0	Who are they kidding ? $ 475 jeans that looked like they came from Kmart and a brand I didn 't recognize ... This place is crap . Techno music and strobe lights blasting so loud I couldn 't stand to try anything on ... Drove by yesterday and saw they were closed . Shocking .	
1	I 've had a great experience here . The acupuncturist is absolutely wonderful . She is attentive and really does care about her patients . I had never done acupuncture before and I was surprised by the results I saw . I have chronic pain in my back and shoulders , and I absolutely noticed a difference . Thanks Mayo !	
1	Absolutely luv this place ! Tina is my go - to manicurist & she 's amazing ! Never have I bleed from her doing my nails , always friendly & we talk the entire time ! Lol I 'm glad I found this place ! !	
0	Was nice for awhile but lately , on weeknights , the vibe has been dragging . And the music played over the soundsystem has been odd , if considered music at all . I guess most people wear headphones anyway but would be cool to have a better vibe with some type of subscription music played overhead .	
0	The market spice buffet was one of my favorite buffets in Vegas but this last time wasn 't so good . Maybe it was because it was 2PM and the food was sitting there for awhile but everything I grabbed was dry . I grabbed one plate and that was enough for me . Luckily , i had the 24 hr pass so I saved my stomach for Caesars that night ... .	
1	Hands down the best donuts in Madison . I love the chocolate cake donuts . I work only a few blocks from there and drive past it going to / from work . It takes a lot of self control not to stop there : P	
0	Worst service . Took over an hour to get our dinner . About 35 minutes to get our drinks . Our server NEVER checked on us . Seems like only 1 server for the whole outside patio . Went to complain to the manager . Never saw him either . He said he would come when he can terrible ! The only reason this place got 2 stars is because the Gorgonzola rib eye was so delicious .	
1	My first time here was great , especially being in town on a trip . The guys working here are super nice and professional and the service was fast and easy . I was more then happy with the outcome of my phone and I 'll definitely be recommending this store to my friends .	
0	Save your money . The food here is way over priced and not worth it . 4 dollars extra to add a piece of chicken the texture of shoe leather to a brown at the edges salad . I remembered why I hadn 't ate here in years despite working at the Venetian often . I had a sandwich last time and was similarly disappointed .	
1	Wonderful flavors , great great Thai food ! I also like to come here for the buffet lunch with a friend . It 's only ten bucks you can 't beat it ! Take your pick you can 't go wrong unless you 're like Ben Stiller in Along Came Polly .	
0	So I am not sure why but twice now we have gotten undercooked pizza . Both times I got sick . If you order the thin crust it 's fine . But both times it was bad it was an XL regular crust with extra cheese . The same employee was working both times so maybe he just undercooks . I am so done with this location .	
1	I love this place ! The staff is very friendly and helpful . My lash artist , Chantel , is AMAZING ! I have been a loyal customer for nearly a year now and would recommend it to everyone . Go get a free consultation ! It will change your life ... just a word of caution : be prepared for constant compliments on your lashes ! : )	
1	Four words : Italian Special Garlic Bread . Scrumptious . The place is a decent value if you get the large and share . Average sandwich shop decor . Super friendly grey haired owner / manager as well as the one male employee who I swear has been there forever . Always forget to get a coupon . I see them in Airpark News .	
1	I love the spicy eggplant here . Its not super spicy so I add hot mustard , but its way yummy . The eggplant is tender , flavorful and melts in your mouth without being mushy . My friend had the Desert Jade Egg Fu Yung and she said it was amazing . The service is good , quick and efficient . Overall a great place to get your chinese food fix .	
0	The Toddy Iced Coffee was weak and flavorless this last time ! What the heck ? I was raving about the coffee here to some out of town guests and I took them there only to have weak flavorless coffee . =	
0	Meh . If I have to choose between Chipotle and Qdoba , I would choose the former . Both places have ample seating area but when it comes to the taste , Chipotle is far more superior . Do yourself a favor and get something better .	
1	Definitely very entertaining ! I had the best original margarita ! Service was awesome ! Shannen was the best server we had for the week that we stayed in Vegas , and we ate out Everyday ! ! ! Thanks again to the staff and a great show ! ! ! I will definitely be back	
0	The bathrooms in this place are disgusting each and every time I visit . The bar is well stoked , the movies good , chairs comfy . Won 't return based on the disgusting bathroom situations . Even on a Tuesday night , these fools can 't get it together ...	
1	A great job at a fair price ! Mark even passed up dessert with his family to come back out and do an extra enzyme treatment while the carpet was still wet . You don 't get customer service like this anymore !	
1	Literally , this place has the best burger I 've eaten in my entire life . So good I went two days in a row . I make it a point to come here every time I visit Vegas . Only problem , which I can 't dock stars for nor would I , this place is only in Vegas . Please please please open up a restaurant in LA !	
0	Pei Wei makes me sad . Sad because it is literally the ONLY Chinese food a downtown resident of the 5th largest city in the country can get for lunch on a lazy hungover Sunday afternoon . : - (	
0	Price is too high for what you get . The food is mediocre , the employees are rude , the manager was leaning on the salad bar talking on his cell phone . Steak was tough , fish was dry and selection very limited . Save your money and spend a few bucks more and go elsewhere .	
1	What a cool little cafe , with a DJ playing early in the morning , delicious berry corn muffins , and good coffee . A little loud for my taste at that hour , but quite a popular little joint , and lots of regulars . Cool artwork on the walls . I was staying nearby for a few days , and for me , this was definitely the best part of this neighborhood .	
0	If you want the best Marbella experience , visit their beautifully designed website , and then stop there . Marbella crafts perfectly mediocre , unimaginative tapas . I have been here thrice and do not foresee a fourth visit - although , the stuffed mushrooms were enjoyable enough . The paella was particularly bad ( dry and tasteless ) . The service and decor are both passable . To be safe , just pass on this place all together .	
1	Zomg , I must rave about this place . Normally , I hate the crust of any pizza , but Papa Del 's crust is soft and absolutely to die for . Every bite was completely orgasmic . Ahhhhhhhhhhhh I want more !	
1	We only stopped to get some pie and were so happy we did . I had cherry and my husband had blueberry crumble and we were in pie heaven . We will definitely come back again in the future .	
1	OMG We had the most amazing meal at this steakhouse . Perhaps because I was not expecting much , or perhaps it was the great company I was with , but I HIGHLY recommend Vic & Anthony ' s . The appetizers , main dishes , drink menus , wine list were all impeccable . It was a truly memorable meal that still makes my mouth water ... .	
0	Horrible don 't give a cr*p service . The worst I have experienced in any restaurant here in the valley ! The manager Gary is an apathetic weasel with no customer service skills . Anyone want to buy a $ 25 gift card from this dump ?	
1	We could not be happier with what Desert Gardens did for us . We completely relandscaped front and back and ( much to my surprise ) added a waterfall that we just love . They were incredibly adaptable and their follow up excellent . Our place looks fabulous ! ! A great experience !	
1	Excellent service . Very good mushroom Kobe burger & truffle fries . Drink not as strong as I would like but acceptable . Tables were clean & chairs very comfortable . Have eaten at this location before & have never been disappointed .	
1	This is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas still even with all of the new ones that have come in and tried to top this place , they can ' t ... . . Bellagio is the best . Its very elegant , always luxurious and I always have a great time here . Always stay here when you are in Las Vegas if you can afford it !	
0	Food was ok , service terrible . Sunday lunchtime and they had many workers running around , but not very attentive to my party of 5 . Like I said , food was ok but certainly not worth what we paid for it . Was like sitting in a barn , and they played alternative rock videos , one would think a pseudo western place would at least play pseudo western music , too .	
1	I stopped in here for breakfast with a couple of out of town friends . We all got their 2 eggs , 2 sausage , 2 back and 2 pancake breakfast . It was massive and it was good . Something like $ 8 per plate . What this place lacks in atmosphere is more than made up for with its character and its food . It 's cash only so be warned !	
1	First time at Jean george ! Can 't believe I 've never been . Service was excellent steak was cooked perfect . Will def be back again soon . Would have to recommend getting a steak , although the salmon looked delicious !	
1	I had bought an alarm system from somewhere else and came to these guys to get it installed . Not only were they polite , but they were very fast ! Everything is working great and have yet to have a problem . I would definitely go back again , and yes , I found these guys due to the reviews already yelp .	
1	I spoke to the owner Phil and he was very apologetic and understanding . I will defiantly be back and was glad to get a call back from him . Its unfortunate that we had that 1 bad day but overall all of our other trips to Zipps have been awesome .	
1	Gandhi is awesome . Please don 't take my word for it , go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and I bet you you 'll fall in love with it . This comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish !	
1	The place is lovely with nice service . If you care about the sanitation , this place is better than mandarin wok or golden harbor for pho . I always ordered the dessert after each meal . Try the dessert , it only costs 1 dollar .	
1	Delicious ! ! I was in the mood for a burger . . but being a pescatarian makes that a bit of a difficult situation . So , I ordered the marinated portabello burger from here ! Delicious , and the sweet potato fries were amazing as well . Would love to come back and try all the bruschettas !	
1	We loved this place , great atmosphere and friendly service . We asked for the freshest fish and Wayne offered to feed us Omakase style . Which was wonderful and reminded us of our old Sushi place in Glendale , CA . Needless to say we were there for hours drinking beer and sake . We can 't wait to go back again real soon ! ! !	
1	Amazing service ! My granddaughter broke her screen and we drove around looking for the best place . All the other places had ridiculous waits or prices ! Quick fix was amazing and so easy to work with . There 's no other choice in the valley !	
1	The super friendly staff is half the reason I keeping back to this place . Always good when your in a hurry and on a budget . You can not beat their prices . It doesn 't hurt they are open super late either .	
1	Food is good for the price . The place is pretty big with lots of big family table . The lunch menu starts off at 5 dollars ! Very good service for Chinatown ! ! ! ! I ordered preserved vegetables with intestines and ma po tofu . Both very authentic ! I always take my family here !	
0	omg This is the only place I have ever been to where the server ( family help ) said they had run out of hot water to make tea . Really ? ? Babies crying , i wasnt sure if i was at their house or restraunt .	
1	Zoom in ... Zoom out ... If you need the pressure checked in your tires this is the best and fastest way to do it . They have a lane dedicated to just checking your air and filling you up : ) Only problem , I forgot to have them check my spare . Wish they would automatically do it since it is just hanging on the back door ! ! !	
0	Went there after hearing about the Arizona Cardinals promotion , if the Cards won , you get a free medium coffee the day after the game . Well , I went , didn 't know about the app for the smart phone . Was told that I need the app and the phone wasn 't with me . Didn 't get the coffee , walked away unhappy .	
1	I decided try this place out because of the good reviews . This place is hidden in a small plaza . It was empty when we got there at noon on a sunday . The food came out fast and The egg rolls were very tasty but i thought the pho was just okay . The food was fresh and the service was good .	
1	This place is awesome ! ! We order probably weekly from them because it 's so yummy and convient . They deliver for free , the food is always hot , fast , and super good ! All the employees are also very nice . We love it and if you like chinese food you will too ! !	
0	The wait was ridiculously long and interiors were dirty . Most of the food we ordered never came out but they kept asking us if we wanted their dynamite . I don 't understand why so many people were raving about it or maybe it was just that one time on Christmas Eve ... . ?	
0	The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat . Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland . Service was good if you don 't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away .	
1	Its really hard to trust people when working with your car . They either upscale you or try to sell you things that you dont need . Joe was true and honest with his price . His work is worth the money spent . As with other reviews on here I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DC Window Tint for your cars tinting needs . Thanks again Joe .	
0	This place sucks I 've been waiting 40 minutes for my TO GO order . What 's the deal ? I 've been waiting 40 minutes for 1 taco and a burrito good thing I smoked before and I don 't have anything else to do but wait for this mediocre food that is conveniently placed a mile from my house . Thanks for the bad salsa and slow service . The food was good tho .	
1	Not sure about the 1 star rating ... ... but every time we have come here the staff has been great ! Dr . Cuellar has been a phenomenal person to work with and has given great advice to help us care for our little one .	
0	I give this place two years tops and they will be gone . Nothing special about this place it 's over priced and will not last long SmashBurger is crushed by even a place like del taco I kid you not . I had a burger at Del taco the day before and it was better then this	
0	We stopped by here for our breakfast , luckily we had Starbucks at hand . My coffee really got me through that thing . I 'm pretty sure my Cinnabon wasn 't finished baking , but they still served it . Honestly , I probably should have picked up breakfast while at Starbucks .	
0	Pretty horrible place subway , firehouse , blimpys , mr goodscents , cousins , Jersey mikes , safeway sub , pretty much any other sub place is 100000 times better , the staff was horrible the food tasted like it was left over from last week and this sub franchise has to be the worst in the valley .	
1	Nice , simple menu for a variety of taste buds . Nice options for people who need gluten and dairy free , as well . Friendly fast service . Nice addition to Desert Ridge . My kids love this place and I do , too . I would like to see a few more menu options , Like grilled veggies , but overall this place is great !	
0	Air conditioning was not functioning at a summer event called WINTERFEST . Seriously ? It may be an okay place to go to see an event , but I wouldn 't risk planning an event there . Big time disaster .	
0	I used to really like Tex Tubb ' s , but the place has gone down hill . I ordered a burrito and the rice and beans inside tasted like plastic . I think they were from the night before . I wouldn 't recommend this place and I won 't be back .	
0	Not a professional run business . Owner is unreliable and did not follow thru for us when we booked him for a day long trip . coach bus is very old and odor coming from bathroom makes it very difficult to sit in back of bus . Bus had mechanical issues and owner did not seem to care when he could not follow thru with what he promised and too late to hire another company ...	
0	Went there for lunch on July 12 on the 2 for 1 the hotel gave us . Pizza was ok and ribs were pretty good . Other than that nothing stood out . Many things were edible , but not a lot of flavor including the pasta bar where they make it for you . Go elsewhere this one is a dud !	
1	This is my go to location on the way to work . They are open super early and in the same direction that I 'm travelling . I hate going out of my way . The staff is very friendly and informative about their product offerings .	
1	I 've dealt with a lot of docs in my job . Dr Tahir was superb . Thoughtful , insightful , listened , took in the full picture , and was extremely intelligent and clear with his diagnosis and treatment recommendations . He stands out as a supremely good example of professional excellence and interpersonal humanity .	
0	Was here yesterday and the service was beyond slow ... my food order was wrong ... . TWICE ! The girl that took my order was nice , but that 's about the only positive thing I have to say about this place . The food was ... . forgettable ... I would 've been better off going to McDonalds and saving myself a couple bucks . The service and the food is just not worth it .	
0	During my 5 nights stay at Ritz , I went to Bistro 24 for breakfast my first morning . I experienced very slow service for Ritz standards . I had to wait a while for someone to wait on . It was not even busy . For the next 4 days , I just walked across the street to Starbucks .	
1	Checked in online and was in and out in under half an hour . Location was clean and my stylist , Tasha , was great . Conversational and adept at what she does - she knew exactly what I was looking for and completed it efficiently .	
0	We ordered this about a year ago shortly after they first opened . Overall the pizza was decent but seemed almost like an at home frozen throw it in the oven style and what really killed it was using CANNED MUSHROOMS ! We will never go again due to our favorite topping coming out of a can ...	
0	K . I 'm not a fan of the neg , but coldstones is my least favorite kind of icecream . Some people love it . I don 't know what it is about the ingredients . But it didn 't taste right to me . Maybe because I 'm do used to real foods .	
1	Atmosphere was definitely 1930 ' s / 40 's and food was excellent . The entertainment was a little loud , so it was hard to carry on a dinner conversation . Friendly staff and food was served quickly . Reservations is a good idea to guarantee seating .	
0	Service was good . I choose a table on the outside of the restaurant so I could people watch while enjoying a snack and drink . Prices are very high ... so much that I regretted not just grabbing some trail mix and a soda from a concession stand . Next time in LAS with time to kill I 'll try a different spot .	
0	Meh , I stopped in at Horny Toad with my lady to have a drink . It was mid - day on a Sunday & the bar area was empty except for us . We didn 't eat , but we had a couple of draft beers . The beers were over $ 4 each & they were served in small glasses . We didn 't even get a full pint ! Lameness , Horny Toad .	
0	Service = EXCELLENT Food = MEH Wine = POOR Our server was great ! The food wasn 't the best . Wine was horrible . Don 't plan for a romantic wine and steak dinner ; the wine was the main problem & didn 't go good with our meal at all ...	
0	I do not recommend this place ! I purchased groupon for the gel manicure and pedicure . I was defintely not satisfied . It was not worth the drive . In plus , they charged an extra five dollars for shellac , opi and other high quality nail polishes . That 's ridiculous . On top of that , the pedicure sucks !	
0	Not very good . 25 min wait for what should be somewhat fast food . The flavors were not very good on any of the 4 items we had . I 'd suggest they reevaluate the menu and then figure out how to be more efficient . People will forgive slow service for good food , but this place is a bust on all fronts .	
0	This place has really gone downhill . Absolutely awful service and Disneyland prices make for a pretty mediocre experience . I had to make two follow up requests for lemons to cover up the chlorine taste in the water , and two requests for bread . They need to hire more staff and lower their prices at least 25 % ... but I know they won 't and that people will still eat here .	
1	This is my go to place for when I need an unlimited supply of Chinese food . Great selection , great food and they never let your glass go empty . They are quick to clean up the table so you have enough room . Nice and courteous . The best part is , they always make sure there is not an empty tray of food . Just writing this makes me want to go back ! ! !	
0	It 's a fine theater and all , but yeah , I can 't go here . Sorry . I thought the audio was a tad loud . More importantly , the seat are just average . I can 't help it . I 've been spoiled by super comfortable seats at other places . dmo out	
1	Red Oak is one of the few places in Oakland where it 's possible to get healthy food . The wraps and salads are great , the food is locally sourced and organic , and the atmosphere inside is rather cool . It can get busy during the school year , but they 're actually rather quick .	
0	The service does not exist here . The worker is just laughing and hanging out with a friend while you self - serve and have to interrupt their conversation to pay . The worker was chatting with her friend even while I 'm paying . That said , their yogurt is one of my favorites : ) Try their greek yogurt . Everything else is icy and not my taste .	
1	Awesome place , great customer service , and amazing prices . Really friendly and knowledgeable . Always helpful , never pushy , very professional . They can even order items for you if they don 't currently stock them ... just ask ! Will return over and over !	
0	Sad experience . Spent 60 . 00 sending flowers to a guest reservation , restaurant manager and general manager both told me they bungled it and were very sorry but NO they don 't really care much about helping me get a refund on flowers they lost . Can 't say this was a good experience or a good way to resolve a problem on their end .	
0	You get what you pay for . Their prices are great but they never ask what you are looking for . They ask you to have a seat and thread your eyebrows however THEY want . On my last visit , I tried to explain I was trying to grow my eye brows out ... they did the opposite and left them completely uneven . l will not be returning !	
1	Right away I was greeted by the owner , I am sure we looked lost . The people shopping inside were just as nice as the people working . They had a large selection of kids comics which is what we were looking for and the reason we will go back . I love being able to help out locally own shops too !	
1	I thought that Le Peep 's was very good . I liked how it was not such a big place , but the right size . I had ordered the Desperado skillet and really enjoyed it . It was a pretty big size that I wasn 't expecting so much ! I had to bring some of it home . It was still tasty when I ate it later . I do recommend this place .	
0	Pretty disappointed ! Visually the restaurant looked nice . The food on the other hand was a different story . The Dinuguan that I ordered barely had meat on it ! Was mostly pieces of Fat / Lard and it was not served warm / hot . Would not go back there again ! !	
1	Pretty surprising for a sports bar . Excellent variety , higher end quality and consistency with everything we 've tried here ! Even their steamed veggies are amazing . Try their honey medium spicy wings ! Bomb ! Great service and drinks .	
0	Ordered the double pepperoni with bacon & add spicy sausage please . Where 's the bacon , where 's the sausage . Very Dry . Little to no cheese or sauce ! ! Not Good ! ! My first and last pizza from Papa John 's & this location .	
1	Steve , great job today on my wife 's Prius ! I pulled into the garage and my first thought , you 're a magician . Thank you for making her new car new again ! I will definitely let my friends know about you .	
1	My favorite place to go to club . The atmosphere is awesome . It is tried to be replicated at other places on the strip but nothing is like this place . I would go back over and over . Go to encore beach club EARLY so you can get in . otherwise you will end up paying lots of money to get into the club .	
0	I came here for the fixed Sunday brunch menu . There are some fun things to try but I did not feel it was worth the $ 50 price . If they brought it down to $ 35 or $ 40 I 'd be more into it but spending $ 60+ dollars each after ( if you get a drink ) seems really ridiculous for Sunday brunch .	
0	Bad customer service . Unprofessional and inconsiderate and rude . A lot of things that they have posted about getting approved or all you need is a check is all false . I have been trying to contact them especially the owner john and he or they do not return calls . Don 't come here . They are money hungry and that 's all they care about . Beware	
1	Their food is always excellent , no matter what I 've ordered ( though I must say I love the Salmon salad with jalapeno dressing and the butternut squash ravioli with truffle oil ) . The firepit is relaxing . The music is fun . The service is sketchy ... touch and go . Don 't go if you 've got a timeline .	
1	Went in for an oil change , and left with a brand new jeep ! This was my second purchase from the Airpark location and I have had excellent service both times . I have worked with both the sales manager Nathan , and the sales person Shawn . They were great help finding the right jeep for me at the right price , and have since followed up with me since my purchase .	
1	Got an apple cinnamon muffin which I loved while I was in the store but my personal favourite was the scone I got with the lemon cream on it . By far THE BEST lemon cream I 've had in a long time .	
0	Well known upscale Italian restaurant that is quite inconsistent . I have had great meals but recently a very mediocre dining experience . Waitstaff were uninspiring and simply went through the motions . There are many places to choose from on the Vegas strip that will give you a better dining experience .	
0	I was a little nervous about shopping here after reading the reviews , but since it was closest to our hotel , we gave it a try . It was fine . Nothing worse than you 'd find in the SF Bay Area . Buck up , little campers . Quit being so stuck up .	
0	Horrible ! ! $ 8 . 00 for cold old cinnamon rolls then tried to see if they would give new ones and the employee was rude and said they are all that way and they can microwave them after microwave even worse now chewy like eating rubber this place sucks and customer service even worse !	
1	I 've been going to Nevada Trails for a few years now and I have nothing but good things to say . Dr . Brian and his staff are courteous and very professional . You won 't be disappointed !	
0	Loved the location on Tatum and shea but since they moved and adopted a new chipotle style concept it has completely gone down hill . The food is bland and sitting in containers for who knows how long . What a disappointment and I will not be going back or referring it to my friends . Bring back the old restaurant and awesome cooks where everything tastes fresh and hot !	
0	Rude service . They blame all their mistakes on the teamsters . Horrible union based company that cannot take any responsibilities for their own actions . If I had a choice I would never use them again but whats the use in complaining when they already have contracts with all the convention halls .	
1	I have been a patient of MVFP for over 10 years . I have a great Dr . ( Roseann Collins ) . And I find them to be organized and efficient . Nothing but good experience with them . Richard	
1	Delicious ! spent the last Mother Day there and it was a great spread ! It is pricey , but worth the interesting , exotic but oh so good flavors . Good Happy Hour all night at the bar area , I recommend the chicken lollipops . I usually do not like dark meat chicken , but I would eat this again and again ! ! ! Service was polite and friendly .	
0	Super greasy and very rare fajitas . Won 't eat them and won 't go back ... it was chilis to go that i ordered online ... that steak that had the texture of a roast is going to get someone sick ...	
1	Happened to be in Ceasar 's and figured if there was any place to stop by and grab lunch , it 'd be at Mesa and sure enough it didn 't disappoint . I had the highly recommended spiced pork tenderloin sandwich which was superb .	
0	The service was fairly friendly , but the coffee was terrible . It cost me $ 3 . 25 for a small coffee with sugar free vanilla syrup . I threw it away , as no amount of cream and sugar could make it drinkable .	
0	Sooo hungover , and new in town , I could only think of this place . It 's cute inside , the waitress was nice , but not very attentive . The plain waffle was flavorless , the bacon uncrisp and small , the potatoes were extra and toast did not come with the meal . Once the headache subsided , I thought of two places that served a better breakast for half the price .	
1	Food is good but not close to great . Service is very good . When we are going to do Mexican we usually go somewhere else , for about 10 - 15 % less we can get a comparable or better meal elsewhere . You cant beat the chips and salsa though which why I give it 4 instead of 3 stars .	
0	More like last option . Totally unqualified people with no common sense . Made our closing very difficult and delayed by more than 3 weeks . Luckily we found a reputable lender with Lone Mortgage and closed in less than 2 weeks .	
1	We stopped in here for a late lunch after touring the Capitol . They had a 51 beers on tap ( ! ! ) and close to 100 in bottles . We tried a local beer and ordered some grub . The food ( salad for me ) , was fine but nothing special . The location of the restaurant and all the beers on tap ( along with the ambience ) definitely makes up for the food .	
0	Seriously , they are not business friendly . Why can you not pay their overpriced bills with a credit card . If they are going to screw you , you should at least get points with your C . C . Why do we not have another choice for our electric ?	
1	i love Petsmart ! best pet store . big , bright , and easy to navigate ! this one is located right next to Walmart ... and the only negative is this shopping complex ... very hard to get on and off Charleston or Decatur .	
0	Wow , I really liked the folks here , and they did pack my item well . However , the international shipment I was sending was based on size and not weight , the box they chose would have cost me and extra 250 . 00 in shipping had I not taken the package home cut the box down and repacked it .	
0	Blech . Yogurt was runny and yet crystallized at the same time -- absolutely not the creamy fro yo that I love . Store was dirty , lots of spillage . I wouldn 't suggest it unless you are desperate for a fro yo fix .	
1	i had lunch with my wife . momo is exellemt . fish is very fresh and good quality . sashimi and kiss of fire roll was so taste it . i strongly recommended momo ' s . customer service is excellent ! !	
1	Very good ! If you 're craving fry bread , this is the place to get it . And yes , real Indians are working there ! Its very fresh . The only complaint is that they charge you for extra honey . The hours aren 't great either . But its good weather it is dessert or lunch time !	
0	Food is pretty good ... service not so much . I can understand service being off when it 's busy but NOT when there 's nobody in the joint but you and one other guy waiting on his order . Smile , ladies ... You 're employed ...	
1	A welcoming yoga community . Angelica 's approach is refreshing - people don 't take themselves too seriously here , like they can at some yoga studios . I love their support of the worthy charity Yoga Gangsters , bringing free yoga to at risk young people .	
1	Super nice staff ! Food is delicious ! So Fresh ! I always sppreciate the hostess asks if we have preferred sesting . Such a simple question but so appreciated . Thankyou Madeleine . Having never eaten there before our waiter John was very helpful . He helped us make the best choices for our appetites and tastes !	
0	I second Crista S 's review above . I bought the Groupon for this place , although it doesn 't look like they even exist anymore . Their number is disconnected , and I could not reach them by email . I 've pinged Groupon to take the coupon off the site , and this place should be removed from Yelp as well .	
1	We only had a milkshake , but darnit , it was the BEST shake ever . It was cherry and chocolate and alcohol . What more could you want ! Also , its enough to split , so $ 5 a person doesn 't seem so bad .	
1	This Beautiful Authentic Gem is the best kept secret in Vegas . The body and mind are lifted the second you walk in the door . The Food is made with integrity and Love . When the food is prepared with this much love , you can taste it in every bite !	
0	After waiting on the phone as caller number one for almost 10 mins , I decided to drive in while still on hold ... After getting parked and in line the casket FINALLY picked up my call . I ordered my food only to get home and it was WRONG . Avoid this location at all cost , I can 't believe they screwed up my meal after all that .	
0	Very disappointed with our meal and the service . It 's a new menu so there are kinks to be worked out , but it besides the beef the burger was a mess . Also , my drink was screwed up . I was willing to put up with the noise and crowd but they 've really fallen off their game .	
1	I absolutely love this seedy and cheap little appendage of Circus Circus . This is the first place I gambled once I hit 21 and it was a blast . Cheap tables , cheap slots , and surprisingly good drink service . Roulette was my favorite and I made about $ 30 bucks ( not bad considering the $ 2 buy - in ) .	
1	Their happy hour prices are very hard to beat . Perfect location next to ASU . Not to mention the sushi quality here is good . Not many places in Arizona can too 101 's sushi I highly recommend this place for people who are 1 ) looking for good sushi , 2 ) looking for a good happy hour , 3 ) looking for great prices especially college students .	
0	Went yesterday for lunch and ordered the sampler platter . The tri - tip was full of fat with no flavor , the small dark meat piece of chicken barely had any meat on it and even though my guest ordered her same meal with no cabbage or rice they still put it on her plate . I will not be returning ... .	
0	I have been here twice for lunch and was underwhelmed both times . There have always been more servers than customers , and yet , my glass stayed empty the entire time . The food was decent , but the portions were a bit small for the price ( we ordered pizza ) . I really wanted to love this place because it is so close to home , but I just haven 't had a great experience .	
0	People must like fishy fish tacos , because this place gets great reviews and a cool hangout , but every time I order fish tacos , they are very fishy . The plates and utensils are usually dirty , maybe is it part of NoDa style . I didn 't enjoy myself . Sorry .	
1	One of the best places we have dined ! The place runs like a well oiled machine and the pizza was out of the park . Wine list is top of the line and they have some great single malt scotch . I 'll be back .	
1	Took my car in for an oil change and was very impressed with the staff . They didn 't try to up - sell me a thousand things I do not need and I was in and out quickly . I was even able to get some work done while I waited since they have free WiFi .	
1	So , I had never gotten a spray tan before this experience . It was surprisingly positive . I thought I 'd come out of there looking like that old chick in Something About Mary ... but it looked FABULOUS ! It looked completely natural . The whole process was quick , professional and comfortable . I loved it and will be back .	
0	Hopefully you never get Erica as a server . She was very rude , rushed , and does not know the golden rule . She argues when questioned . I think because we all look younger she thought we wouldn 't tip well , her mistake . WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS CHILIES !	
1	Really good bagels and great service . The apple cinnamon seasonal bagel is crazy good . Place is clean , service is nice . We 've had a lot of Einstein bagels brought to us , but never visited a location ; this is a great alternative to Starbucks for the road - trip traveler .	
0	It 's hard to like this place after Taj Mahal -- but there were many choices and it wasn 't the worst , but it really wasn 't the best . Some stuff was over salted and the chicken tikka was dry .	
1	G&D was our first stop for our Pub Crawl , the fried food sampler was good and the drinks were decent pour and priced . The server was nice and everything went well . The location is lose to a rail station with just a short walk .	
0	The worst Salmon I 've ever had . The service was garbage . The restaurant was dirty and again ... the worst Salmon I 've ever had . I 've been to my share of Hard Rock Cafe 's so , for food , service , cleanliness . . I 'll have to give two thumbs down in a 360 rotation .	
0	This restaurant was definately over priced . All the stories you hear about how cheap it is to eat in vegas , complete lie . Although I did stay on the strip , but still i dont think I had a single meal under $ 13 . That adds up quickly . The food here was good , but nothing to write home about .	
0	Meh . Is about the perfect way to describe this place . First , it 's too expensive ( I know it 's Vegas , on the Strip , but improve quality if you 're going to have such high cost ) . Food was okay at best . With so many other places at all different price ranges no need to eat at this one .	
1	I have been to 3 of the Kona Grill locations and they all have been good . Great food and the happy hour is the best . Great place to meet people during happy hour and great drinks and food . Pretty trendy .	
1	Not as good as Persian Room , yet they have really good meat and great service . Hookah is well packed , hookah guys are nice and change out charcoal and maintain regularly . Lots of options . They also have live music sometimes . Drinks are pretty good too .	
1	Amazing experience ! Came with a large party and had no issues . Server was polite and accommodating to everyone . We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries as appetizers . Tried several different burgers and there was not a single disappointed person in our group . Great mix of flavors ! Great quality ! Cannot wait to go again and try more of the menu . Highly recommended !	
0	Ok definitely the worst restaurant I have been to in Scottsdale ! ! ! The service is slow ! ! ! ! They messed up every single item we ordered . The restaurant had a terrible draft and the food was mediocre . I would never ever go here again ! Many better options for Mediterranean food in Scottsdale . A definite add to the must miss list . Blech .	
0	Another rippoff but then what are the options for breakfast at 4am . As much as they charge for a Bacon , Egg & Cheese Biscuit and 1 lityle 2 - inch piece of Bacon . REALLY ? This place sucks and I should have stsyed away . Make sure to count your change too !	
0	So , I have a $ 60 . 00 credit that SWA has held for a year . I asked them for a refund and their reply was that I needed to book a flight within three days or they keep my money . How cheap can they get ? They didn 't even offer me an extension for another flight !	
0	I have been to this restaurant dozens of times throughout the years . I find the steaks are always good , but the seafood is really hit or miss . Was there yesterday and my lobster was totally over cooked . It was like complete rubber . It was barely edible . I should have known better to order it there , but I love surf and turf so I gave it a shot . Very disappointing .	
0	Just horrible ! More security than an airport with armed guards wielding guns menacingly who are complete and utter jackasses with less sense than the TSA . Was so exited to go to the FrightDome for Halloween but after how poorly I was treated right off the bat I decided that the 300 plus dollars we were about to drop would be better spent elsewhere . I have never been treated worse by an establishment than I was here .	
1	Great little airport . Now direct connection to Europe . Live piano music in terminal . Us airways hub . Rental car shuttles run every few minutes . Lots of charging stations for electronic devices . Airport is also small enough to make transfers easy .	
1	Best Italian food in Tempe . Love the vibe ! So friendly . Capellini is great , so is the Tiramisu . Great wine list & good happy hour ( before 6 pm ) prices . Oh yeah - also love the broccoli Stromboli .	
1	I don 't know what is wrong with people giving this place 1 or 2 stars complete wackos , because my girlfriend and I have been eating here as regulars for 3 years the food is always excellent maybe some things slip but it 's probably because the place is so busy has nothing to do with the food . We will always recommend this establishment .	
1	What a wonderful place to have lunch . Our server , Nick , was polite , attentive , fun and enthusiastically knowledgeable . The steakhouse salad was superb , the green goddess juice was delightful , and the drinks were well made and quick to land . The atmosphere was light and airy , and it was not noisy in spite of being a large room full of patrons . I look forward to returning .	
0	Was here recently and service was terrible plus food was not as tasty as it has been at other Macaroni Grills I have been to . Our waitress disappeared for a good 20 minutes before she even brought us water . Took forever to get our food and it was mediocre . I was really surprised because I have eaten at several Macaroni Grills in valley , Tucson and in other states .	
1	LGO was fantastic . Great food , great staff , and an outstanding storefront with the best English Muffins I have ever tasted . I have dined in twice ; however , and found the service to be a little on the slow side . Also , with regard to crowding and poor parking , LGO suffers from both .	
1	It had a super buffet for a Saturday ! I loved every morsel of it . Keep in mind it 's south Indian so it 'll be on the spicy side , But everything has amazingly bold flavors . The staff were so nice , they helped my grown daughter choose her food since she is new to Indian food and doesn 't like spicy . I 'll definitely be back . Go try it !	
1	Such a great atmosphere ! An amazing burger with killer fries and a garlic aioli sauce . What stood out most was the superb customer service . Cori was an absolute joy . She was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and super friendly . Thanks so much to the entire staff ! We never wanted for anything . Highly recommend 5th and Wine , and definitely worth a return visit !	
1	Ra is a tradition for us . When I get to go home to the valley there always seems to be a girls ' night out . Great service and great food , all the time . Try their coconut creme brulee if you 're in the mood for something sweet . You won 't be disappointed ! Prices are best at happy hour- of course .	
0	Don 't bother stepping foot into this place if you value your time . Customer service leaves a lot to be desired , and I just finished waiting over two hours to get a small leak repaired . AVOID THIS STORE	
1	Every Jimmy John 's will get you generally the same quality food , but at this location , these guys are FAST ! It 's like they psychically read what you 're thinking . We always joke that your order goes like this : Me : I would like a . . Employee : HereYouGo ( Sandwich handed to you before you finish your sentence )	
1	I recently had a great experience at Austin Village Eyecare . The staff was great and I was able to set up an appointment in no time . Dr . Bhat was thorough and took extra time to explain and discuss all of my options . Extremely convenient and the office is very clean and modern . Thanks Dr . Bhat !	
0	Service was slow . 7 rolls came out one at a time over the course of 45 minutes so that no one really ate together . At the end , a gratuity was automatically added . We had a party of 5 . Never heard of an automatic gratuity for a party of 5 , but then again , I have never had worse service .	
1	We loved it . We have finally found a great gelato shop in Charlotte . Have the pistachio . Bring back your friends , they will love it . Get back on yelp and let the people know what you think .	
1	My husband and I tried this place for the first time tonight . My tepanyaki was amazing . My husband had sashimi and loved it . The pieces were a little small and the menus were sticky , otherwise I would have given it 5 stars .	
0	Stores aren 't that exciting , food selection sucks . Really isn 't so much an outlet mall as it is a crappy outdoor mall . I wouldn 't come back . But if you are too stupid for your own good definitely swing on by !	
1	Really great moving company . With these guys - what you see is what you get . They won 't nickel and dime their customers or charge them for petty things . They also include drive time in the overall charge so that 's a huge plus ! Really good people . I plan on using them again next month when I move .	
1	The salsa is really good . I liked mixing the tomatillo ( medium ) with the hot salsa on the chip . Gives it a smokey , sweet flavor . For my entree I had the Pescado Verde . Very flavorful fish dish . I highly recommend eating on the patio . There are fire pits , water features and fun Mexican decorations . Very secluded with plenty of shade .	
1	For an airline today , southwest is pretty good . The free bags ( 2 per person ) are a very nice bonus . If you took 2 bags for each leg of the trip , that would be $ 100 per person on any other flight ! You can tell the workers love working for southwest and are some of the funniest flight attendants around !	
1	My favorite chicken tortilla soup and corn bread . Great indoor or outdoor seating . Many times I have called in for take out food there for dinner parties and have never been disappointed . The food holds great in chaffing dishes and the corn bread is terrific for dinner parties . Cut it into four pieces and place in a linen covered bowl to keep warm and moist . Reheats fabulously .	
1	Excellent food ! Have been here many times over the years- both dine in and take out , and it is always excellent food . Amazing pizza and wings . Their teriyaki sauce is superb . Top notch . Will be a customer for years to come .	
0	This place sucks . It 's small , and their advertisements all over TV are BS . They don 't have any regular keno machines . Payouts on the machine games are crap . Only thing they have going for them is the location . I was super excited to be able to hit a casino 30 minutes from Glendale instead of having to go out to Casino Arizona or Fort McDowell . Won 't make that mistake again .	
1	If your a fan on McFarlane toys this is the store for you . i have loved the artristry of McFarlane for many years and have bought the toys as i have seen them in places like walmart . this is a very specilized store for McFarlane toys so its not for all toy lovers .	
1	Just ate there for my first time and it was delicious . Great , friendly staff and the food was phenominal ! I had the Carne Advocada , which was superb ( tasty with a little heat that lingers ) , and the PB&J Pasty dessert ( absolutely amazing ) . I will definitely come back ( when I 'm back in town ) .	
1	Caleb is the best ! I work at the salon up the street , and this place is always nice to walk into . My boyfriend has been coming here , and the customer service is top notch . He was a hardcore tobacco chewer for 15 years and hasn 't bought ANY since he started vaping . The knowledge here is top notch . Very welcoming to beginners . I recommend everybody here for starter sets or flavors .	
0	The food still sucks but it 's perfect for getting wasted and dance on the bar . Shot shot shot shot ! Hopefully I don 't loose a shoe and end up in the river bottom . Friends don 't let friends get fucked up and drown in Tempe town lake .	
0	The staff at this location just take the cake . They are pure rude just unkind so not humble or friendly people . How can they help people with such nasty attitudes its beyond me . How they have a job at all is beyond me . I will never return here .	
0	Hadn 't been back here in sometime . Was very disappointed at the slow service and mediocre food quality . Sure not like it used to be . Even the manager negotiated what she 'd bring in response to a simple request for sour cream . Too bad . Used to be a favorite with good food , drinks , service , and ambiance . Seems even the ducks have moved on .	
0	Disappointing . The food was below average and the service was ok . We were expecting a lot from this restaurant but it definitely did not deliver . Pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best . Wine selection is very weak . The outdoor seating is a redeeming quality .	
0	The venue was fine for an airport , service was fairly quickly however the food was not great . I had a veggie omelette , nothing was mixed in except for a lot of cheese , it was very oily and didn 't taste that great . It was also pricy for what it was .	
1	Had the Tonkatsu - Shoyu Ramen ( pork + soy sauce broth ) . The food arrived quickly , and the portion size was just right ( not too big , not too small ) . The decor is minimal , but tasteful . Kenzo focuses on just the Ramen and does it well .	
0	Dave , one of the technicians at Desert Pool is very unprofessional and rude . He was very condescending to both my wife and in addition to quoting us a price and then once he started the work he tried to increase the price on us ! I would suggest calling anyone but them .	
0	Danger Will Robinson ! Avoid this place . Stale chips , Pace Picante salsa , microwaved food . I ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen . Server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu . The dining area is extremely shabby : ripped cushions and dingy tables . I do not know why I stayed after the first five minutes .	
0	The biggest mistake I made this year . For starters the staff was rude and displayed poor customer service . The ride is mediocre , I would rather buy a timeshare in Louisville , Kentucky that pay to ride the High Roller again . Don 't do it ! ! ! ! !	
1	So delicious ! Came here during a lay over at 11pm . Lots of good side dishes . I normally dont like meat , but the korean short ribs was so sweet and yummy that I finished the entire plate . Seafood tofu was a winner .	
0	Usually good but today was terrible . Ordered eggs basted soft . Got scrambled . Sent back and they came back cold , basted with oil and burnt around the edges . Toast was pretty much NOT toasted . Manager brought out more eggs as we were paying the bill . They adjusted the check though , so that was nice .	
0	The food is good but the service is terrible . We were four people and they brought our orders one by one . . We went there for the breakfast and asked them to have wheat bread , we almost finished our food and they finally served us bread at the last moment . by the way it 's too expensive for this kind of food and service .	
0	Disappointed . Small portion for the money . Tortillas were hard and cold . And our server was too busy flirting with 60 something old ladies . He didn 't even offer to refill my soda . I even had to go find him to pay . 1 star is for the ok food . Service would get a zero	
1	Solid sports bar ! Went here for the women 's world cup finals and had a great time . Bloody mary 's were awesome and the appetizers were a nice surprise . The jalapeno poppers were yummy and the sliders were nice too . Service was great and I 'll definitely be back ... they 've got Murphy 's on tap ! !	
1	Very easily made my first appointment . The front desk staff is incredibly accommodating and friendly . I had no problem making an appointment ... they took me in first thing the next morning . Dr . Hajbandeh was nice and explained everything very thoroughly and didn 't appear to be in a rush to see his next patient .	
1	Always our favorite place for breakfast when we are in Las Vegas . If you love home cooking this is your place . The menu has a variety of items that are specials ... try them ! The service is great as is the food !	
0	Love the food but the service the past 4 times has been not pleasant . There is a worker who isn 't professional and sometimes his comments can be rude . I just want to eat in peace and not be bugged with nonsense like this kid skates around doing .	
1	Great food . A bit pricey even for Vegas . The sangria a were not the best we have ever had but not the worst either . All the tapas were really good and unique . Prepare to spend some cash .	
0	Bad customer service . They got my order wrong then they started talking about me in Spanish not realizing that I speak Spanish . $ 7 burrito was the size of a taco bell burrito . I 've lived in El Mirage for the past 14 years and have been coming to this spot and the one on thunderbird for years . This was definitely the last time .	
0	Bring back the original ! There pasta is poor to avg , the portions were good but who cares when the food is avg . Waiter couldnt get it right and came back a few times asking what we wanted . Whats that all about ? I miss the Lombardinos in the 70 ' s , 80 's and early 90 ' s .	
1	Sin city smashburgerrrr ... yum Love this place . Seems like its always busy so you might have to wait . I usually pick up because the tables are full . Veggie frites are awesome and the chocolate malts too .	
1	We had a great meal here . The place was packed ! The servers were slow initially BUT it was packed and once we were seated , the service was fine . Tons of vegetarian options . The food was well spiced and the portions were sufficient . I would visit again . 5 stars !	
1	AMAZING PLACE ! Great atmosphere , amazing food ... The only thing I could complain about was the service . It was a Wednesday late after noon so not too busy and our waitress didn 't come by much . Other than that I would suggest the curry and carna ASADA dish and their fries !	
1	We regularly eat here . It is a very easy and casual dining experience . the food is and sevice is consistant . We love the sizzling salmon and the chinesechicken salad . The tai mai drink is very potent ! very friendly staff . They are great about altering orders too -- special requests .	
1	$ 5 . 95 lunch special including soup and egg roll . They have the best sweet and sour chicken , beating any other restaurant I 've eaten in ( including Chinatown in San Francisco . I have been here twice and the service is great . I like refills on my drink and was always taken care of promptly .	
1	I recently purchased a 2012 Dodge Ram Laramie Limited from Prestige and i must say every step of it was amazing ! ! ! ! i have purchased several vehicles with this company and everyone has been great and super easy . Tino and Rennie are the best if you ever need a new car ask for them ! ! ! ! ! !	
1	This is THE BEST popcorn ever ! They have tons of different flavors . They will also let you sample the flavors before you purchase them . All the employees are friendly as well . The location is a little out of the way but well worth it ! !	
1	I really enjoy their subs and the poutine they serve here . The service is also friendly and quick regardless of the time of day or night . But the establishment is a little dirty specially the bathrooms . Atleast tonight ... Overall i belive i will return here .	
1	This place is awesome . What I think an old fashioned supper club would be like . Huge bar and lots of seating . The cheese curds are delicious and the fish fry is a must order ! Good parking too .	
1	This place is FUEGO ! Easily the Best burger in the City . I 've eaten almost everything on the menu but really enjoy the Euro Burger . Truffle aioli , goat cheese and warm tomato - BOOM ! Gordon also makes up a great shake but the Chocolate Hazelnut pudding , coffee , praline cookie is mind blowing . If your UP any money THIS IS THE PLACE TO SPEND IT .	
0	The wings were ok but got mostly legs . I prefer wings . The cheese dip was cold but flavors were Ok . The staff is funny and friendly . The fish and chips were over cooked . Everything was overpriced . For 2 Cokes , 2 small margaritas , chips and cheese salsa , fish And chips , and wings , the price was $ 85 !	
0	My company ordered this place for lunch the other day to cater about 100 employees . The pizza delivery man was late , the pizza was cold , and my employees weren 't too happy . It isn 't that good of pizza . I had one slice and I 'll never have it again .	
0	I get so frustrated when you get home and most of the order is incorrect or items are missing . What more do I need to say about that ? The interior is surprisingly dirty / messy , especially considering the location . The last time I dined at this location I said out loud that I can 't believe the condition of this place and had I known I would make the choice to go elsewhere .	
1	The day we went there , we dint find any pizzas on their menu . We were kinda puzzled - isn 't a pizzeria supposed to serve pizza ? We 're mostly vegetarians , so we ordered their caprese and vegetarian sandwich hot . was so good . will definitely go back !	
1	It 's only open for take out and lunch , but its so good . If you 're a 1st timer , ask how to order , he 's no Nazi , but you may not know what your looking at . Try lots of sides and veggies . Everything I 've tried was fresh , healthy , and delicious .	
1	don and darnell just made my white carpet whiter than it has ever been ! and its been about an hr and its dry ! no wet socks syndrome ! go with this company best in the vegas valley trust me i have had them all !	
1	Just had dinner there with my wife . I got the New York steak . It was nicely seasoned an cooked a perfect medium rare . The menu sates it is usda choice and by the tenderness I am sure it was . My wife had chicken parmesian . Both come with salads and portions are generous . Bill including two beers was $ 37 . 00 . We will definitely be coming back .	
0	Service started out ok ... then waitress spilled grease in my suit jacket and then it went downhill . She was replaced and then wait staff was distant from my table . Manager apologized and comped entire meal ... but suit is ruined ... . . very incompetent staff ... . Never going to return ... .	
0	My 4 friends and I were disappointed today when we drove over 10 miles to your sandwich shop on Fort Apache . We arrived 7 : 25pm and the shop was closed ! The store hours say open until 8 : 00pm and there were at least 2 employees inside but no one would let us in . We ended up going across the street to Arby ' s . Major bummer !	
1	There are a lot of things to like about Joe ' s . The food is fresh and tasty . Prices are quite reasonable . The coffee ROCKS ! The diner / greasy spoon vibe is comfortable . The servers are fast , friendly and competent . And I can walk there from my house ! Now - if I could just get a better appreciation for breakfast . ( Haven 't tried the lunches yet ... )	
0	Kinda blah ... their yogurt tastes kinda watered down or something . It just isn 't as creamy and sweet as other places around the valley . I do like the variety of toppings and the staff is really friendly , but overall it 's nothing special .	
1	Awesome place our kickball team goes here almost every Monday . . The staff is always nice and friendly and food and drinks are fast . . There prices are great . Love this place cant wait till next week for more ... : )	
1	After reading such rave reviews about this place I figured I had to check it out ! The service here is fantastic ! I was quickly greeted and seated . My server was also very knowledgeable about the menu . I ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious ! The prices are very reasonable ! I recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive comfort food .	
1	DELICIOUS FOOD ! The service was wonderful . We ordered the bbq and the servers helped us cook the food . It was a great value for the amount of food they give you . I loved the Chap Chae and the tofu soup was awesome too . We 'll definitely be back .	
0	This club could have some potential but it 's always empty . I 've been here 4x since grand opening a few weeks ago and it 's slower and slower every time . Staff is polite once inside . It literally takes 20 - 25 minutes in heavy weekend traffic to get from Bellagio to the SLS . They might as well be on their own island .	
0	So slow ! ! The staff was really slow and more busy talking about what they were gonna do over the weekend then hurry and bring patients back ... I hear they have appointments ... I will do that next time and see how long it takes ... .	
0	Ordered chicken wings along with our pizza , I guess that gal up front didn 't know that there fryer wasn 't working ... needless to say didn 't get the wings ... oh well . The kids had fun , except for that one game that took our coins and didn 't deliver the opportunity to play ... did get a refund ... will not be visiting this location anytime soon ...	
0	Disgusting . Ordered a double whopper which was inedible . I took about 4 bites cause I felt bad wasting it . But then I just had to throw it away cause I couldn 't take it anymore . Don 't bother visiting this location . Disgusting waste of money . Sad , cause I used to love the whopper .	
1	I absolutely love Jo Jo 's China Bistro ! It is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte . The general tso 's chicken is awesome ! They have a waiter named Jimmy that is one of most colorful characters you will meet . He always makes my boys laugh . They have great outside dining and their website usually has an $ 8 off coupon for lunch . Very nice !	
0	Horrible customer service . I just watched the man in front of me get treated like crap over a $ 1 additional charge . The cashier was dismissive and flat out rude . I won 't be coming back here and neither will that man . She just lost this business 2 customers over $ 1 and her bad attitude . The quality of the wash was decent hence the 2 stars .	
1	BACON IN THE WAFFLE ! ! genius . its our new tradition now , every time we come to vegas we gotta eat here for breakfast . dont mind the 45 min wait , its well worth it : )	
0	Sundays used to be all you can drink vodka for 10 dollar cover ... After paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are 2 dollars ... Why would anyone come on Sunday if they 're pouring 2 dollar glasses of cranberry juice ?	
1	First trip to Heritage Tavern since it opened . Very good experience with traditional decor and warm atmosphere . Great service . Food was very good to excellent . I had the braised lamb belly . It was perfectly cooked but had a very strong if not too strong of a lamb flavor . Friends had the braised short ribs which were excellent . We will be back .	
1	Try adobo rice ! Everything was good ! Since none of Indonesian restaurant in Arizona , the foods in this restaurant was similar with Indonesian foods with different name such as La Ing for Cassava leaf coconut sauce or Sayur Singkong , Sinigang fish soup was awsome although I prefer with pampano fish ( they didn 't use this fish ) ... I always come again ! Highly recommended !	
0	Very nice store . They had a couple really cute dogs walking around and one in baby crib that was just adorable . This is a great place to go for one of kind items or great gifts for the dog lover but nobody paid attention to us . Nobody made eye contact nobody said hello so we just walked out .	
0	horrible service . . Ruined my family breakfast , I decided to give them another chance months later but I ordered to go because I didn 't want to deal with the attitude , Only to get home and see the wrong order ! ! $ 18 for a wrong breakfast . .	
1	Nice alternative for an afterwork dinner . Exceptional service and reasonable prices . Food and beverages offered are awesome , and if you enjoy something simple , the chocolate chip cookies for desert are a great surprise . The sports bar atmosphere doesn 't feel as canned as some others ... great staff attitude goes chapters in making a nice experience .	
0	Scum bag owners . Worst customers service ever . One owner Jorge Lolpez tried over charge fuel+carwash for drop off haul 's truck ... . I called the company for complain about this jerk guy with attitude and I change drop off the truck in different location with no charge . Don 't go here this guy don 't deserve any kind business .	
0	The customer service is absolutely terrible . I have been there 3 times now , giving it a fair chance , and each time the employees were rude . I went tonight to try and redeem a groupon and they said that they did not accept it and that groupon had made a mistake . There were no exceptions . NOT how a small business should be run . I will not be back	
1	Our youngest daughter required oral surgery at the age of 6 . Dr . Gillis and his staff were incredible with her . They scheduled her for first thing in the morning and Dr . Gillis had her done in under a half hour . They were very patient and kind with her - I could not have been more pleased . Thank you , Dr . Gillis !	
0	10 / 19/2014 I was messaged here on yelp by someone claiming to work for this company ... . I was asked if I would please edit my review to a 5 star and to change my story for a free bottle of ejuice ... . WOW this place just gets worse and worse that 's so pathetic .	
0	Two stars is all I give this place because of service . I really like the sushi here but after more then one really bad experience with the service , my good will has run out . Now I just avoid the place .	
0	I love the wings but the service is atrocious , I come here every week and every time I 'm shocked by the lack of management and disregard for basic customer service . If you come here DO NOT I repeat , DO NOT make plans for after . You will be here for a while .	
0	We 've been here several times and we were disappointed this week . Our heirloom tomatoes are soft and near rotten . The grouper had an ammonia taste to it . My grilled salmon was very bland . The best item was the dessert butter cake and whip cream . To summarize , disappointed and expensive .	
0	I fly Southwest a lot , but the past few trips have been extremely frustrating . They used to always be on time , lately they are constantly delayed . I have to think they 've changed something with their management . This delayed stuff used to be the exception , now it 's the norm . Time to switch to another carrier ?	
1	I don 't know about you , but this is my favorite pizza place in all of Pittsburgh ! Can 't go wrong with Aiello ' s . It 's small and cozy , but it 's exactly what I 'd expect from a pizza place on Sq . Hill . Late college night ? Try this pizza . It is amazing , it is delicious , and I wish I could go here more often .	
1	Nice play to enjoy a burger and watch all the weirdos walk by . I like the atomic fries , blue cheese burger and also the jack Daniels burger . If you are an industry worker they 'll give you 25 % off .	
1	By far one of our favorite local places to go . From friendly people to fantastic food , this place rocks ! There are so many creative menu choices and I 'm dedicated to working my way through them all . The coffee is a special blend they had roasted just for them . The cheese cake is also very good and features a unique angel food cake crust . This is a great local find .	
1	This Marriott is in a prime location . Just a few blocks from the nightlife section near ASU . Although it is very close to the entertainment , surprisingly it is a quite place . The desk was very helpful . The beds are super comfortable . The price was much better than the others that double the price for the same location .	
1	I was visiting from Los Angeles for my little sister 's birthday & was skeptical because I 'm usually a stick with what I know kind of person . Oh , & I 'm serious about my cupcakes ! = ) Well , Cupcake Lane did NOT disappoint ! They were exceptional . My sister was excited & loved them . I will recommend them to all my local friends . Thank You !	
0	To the owner , I know your reviews have not been very good , so here is what I am suggesting give me a free lap dances ( as long as it is not Suzy Q ) and I will write you a great review . And I agree since I have only spent a half hour in your establishment .	
0	The latte is good ( trust me , almost any coffee would be good after a night out in vegas and early morning conference wake up call ) , but the lines here are ridiculous since it 's right next to the conference area . Save yourself some time and go to the Starbucks outside . It 'll be faster ( even though it looks farther ) .	
0	No WiFi on top floors u needed a laptop to whook up to internet via eather net cable who the he 'll uses laptops anymore lol ... toilet took 2 hours 2 fill up before used again ... . very out dated and dingy feeling hotel ... Won 't recommend	
1	I have been using Busy Bee for years in my rental homes , my business and my own home . They have been very consistent and have worked with me around my schedule . Special requests have been accommodated on most occassions and the owners are very professional . I would recommend them , they will most definitely suit anyone 's needs .	
1	Seriously amazing dinner tonight for the Wine Club ! Strawberry Spinach Salad , Pheasant for dinner ( yummy ) & the most amazing Bread Pudding for dessert ! I can 't drink tonight but everyone had a 100 point wine plus a $ 500 wine & $ 1000 wine & said they were awesome !	
0	Was wanting one of those humongous margarita 's everyone was walking around town with . I got a pina colada flavor and the whole thing was a giant slushy . No alcohol taste whatsoever . I guess I paid the price for falling into the the tourist trap type drinks . Not doing that again .	
0	review for casino floor ONLY . dark dark dark . i remember reading when it opened , how light and bright it was inside the casino floor . NO it 's not . very dark throughout . again , oddly shaped -- just one long corridor with slots and tables . more dark than Red Rock ... and Red Rock is pretty dark inside . spacing just seems off and thrown together . i don 't know .	
0	Has a convenient location and it is fresher than other Paradise bakeries , however experience is absolutely ruin by bad customer service . There is very few people that have customer service here as compared to other locations , most of them are guys ! I 'm never coming back to this location thanks to the cashier named Lirio .	
0	We ordered the poutine . No gravy and was flavorless ! Beer pretzels were gross ! ! ! Ran out of Caesar dressing so couldn 't get a salad . Bottom line , don 't come here for the food . Just the beer and cute wait staff .	
0	I can 't say anything about living here because I will NEVER move in here . I was looking for an apartment and the sales lady was extremely rude . Also , beware that the prices they email you and the prices the sales person will give you will be different !	
0	All show and no go , snow crab other then king crab , Italian station and Mexico syations tasted very salty , waited 20 min to get in , counted 25 empty tables , deserts tasted weak , would not go back	
0	Prices weren 't low on half that items that I saw . I picked up a block of cheese and it felt like jello , I assume it felt that way because it had been left out in the heat for a while .	
1	The only reason I didn 't give a 5 star rating is because in wish the outdoor seating area were larger . Great coffee and the breakfast sandwiches are large and delicious . My husband and I love to walk the Greenbelt here .	
1	This no frills joint has been on my list for years . I keep it simple every time . Jambalaya or Gumbo over rice extra crackers . When I am jonesing for the New Orleans flavor this is my spot . It gives The Oyster Bar at Palace Station a run for their money . It could use a little swagger , but I don 't go there to party .	
1	Seattle may have just won the 2014 Super Bowl , but the Steelers still rock with six rings , Baby ! ! ! Just stating what all Steeler fans know : a Steel Dynasty is still unmatched no matter what team claims the title of current Super Bowl Champs . . Go Steelers ! ! !	
1	Finally an authentic taco shop in AZ ! ! ! Reminds me of home sweet home ( chicago ) . All the staples are there ... 2 corn tortillas , cabbage , red salsa , limes ... . they even have ground beef ... A rarity in these parts . Couldn 't be happier : D	
0	Whoa . Next time you see a $ 8 . 99 buffet , don 't fall for it ! My friend and I sat eating for 20 minutes , pretending to enjoy , and finally we looked up at each other and knew we couldn 't take it anymore . Want to go to McDonald ' s ? I did . I really did .	
1	So let me start with . . I had never had Pho until I went here on Thursday . With that being said , I have nothing to compare Pho Avina to . But . . reviewing service and food . Service- good . Fast . Helpful . Food - we had spicy beef soup , chicken and shrimp soup and coffee boba . All was really good .	
1	Had the burger with bacon and fried egg was so tasty that I tried eating it all , I tired . The wife had the turkey club and of course that was bomb with avocado . So full still want more come and get yr grub on at Mimis Cafe it 's a yummy time in yr tummy . Ha	
1	I had a BBQ Beef Sandwich at Chase 's Diner today . Good food as well as good fries . This is one of those 50 's style diners that 's fun to eat at . I also like the sign I read when eating there that stated , All Unattended Children Will Be Given an Espresso and a New Puppy . Hilarious .	
1	Simply the best medical care anywhere . When I read negative reviews I really wonder if they staggered into the same business that I did . The Mayo has been an exceptional experience for me and I found that the quality of care and the caring staff are the two real differentiators for me . Thank you Mayo Clinic for the great care ! !	
1	Love this local pizza shop ! Our family has ordered here for several years , always great service and consistent food . The hot sauce tends to be on the hotter side so we only choose the mild sauce and it 's warm enough . I would recommend this pizza shop .	
1	They have breakfast and lunch pretty well figured out . They don 't have *everything* , but what they do , they do well . We 've had the bad luck of having one certain server several times that isn 't as good as the others . Doesn 't ask what kind of bacon you want of the eight choices , nor which sides for sandwiches . She couldn 't figure out how to accommodate a flavored green tea .	
0	Service is just so slow , especially in the drive thru . A couple of bean burritos for the kiddos is going on 30 minutes ... no one in front of us . This is maybe my fifth time thru this location and it just keeps getting worse .	
0	So go thru the drive thru and get ignored . No one answers then decide ok I will go inside . Once inside the only person in the place doesn 't acknowledge I am there while he is making good and I am there at the counter waiting 20 min and not one word . WORST SERVICE EVER ! ! ! !	
1	Came back , and I 'd write the exact same review all over again . Now pass me the potato gnocchi , please . And as for Tony P 's issue , sorry Tony - but go marry yourself that British chic and bring her back here for some good Gnocchi and Chianti ! I 'll buy if you do !	
1	Hubby indulged my tastebuds tonight and my tastebuds couldn 't be happier . Ordered the spring rolls as recommended and the didn 't disappoint . I got B2c pork and shrimp vermicelli with an extra side of fish sauce . Sooooo good . I couldn 't help saying mmmmmm after every bite . Definitely going back !	
1	As long as your not trying to go at prime time during the weekend , your fine . Beware , this place gets packed during peak hours . Def get the takoyaki , yellowtail tar tar , butter fish and eel fried rice ! Just thinking about it is making me droooool	
0	The food was ok , but far from great . There were a few items that I really liked , but there were far more that let me down . Service was horrible . Dirty plates piled up and it was impossible to get water or champagne refills . I would expect this type of service at a $ 8 buffet , but when the bill is $ 45 a head I expect a little more .	
1	My husband and I had lunch at Botero this past weekend and it was terrific ! Sat outside by the pool and though much of the bikini scenery worked against an appetite , the food was delicious . Had a lovely chopped salad with rotisserie chicken , greens and pistachios . Enjoyed warm tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa . Husband had some sort of panini and french fries . Absolutely LOVE the art at Botero !	
0	I have since found out that Bob Evans sold this off and they have gone to a more French menu . This explains the reduction of choices . I am not impressed and will likely never go to Mimi 's again unless there is a change in the menu .	
1	This place is a classic , if your in the mood for Mediterranean or if you are hosting a dinner party last minute . The food tastes great , moist and juicy meats , great sizes and they have this yummy I 've cream my daughter loves . I think it 's made from safron , anyways it 's a great little spot for home cooking .	
1	My husband come here every week ... . the staff is friendly and always on point . Miranda and the other bartender girl are amazing . I would suggest you give them a try . I 'm so in love with the 9oz steak ...	
1	Tia Jackson is a phenominal stylist ! If you are looking for a stylist for hair color , extensions or hair cuts she is the best . She truly listens to what style you want and delivers every time . Best extensions professional in Charlotte ! !	
0	This place is terrible i been to many foot massages and this is the worst , the attendants just keep talking the entire session , using their phones while working , the massage is terrible its like they are not in the mood of working and do their job . Go and spend your money somewhere else any other place in china town is 10 times better	
0	This place is OK but not great . I wonder if they don 't develop convenient amnesia when packing up the orders . My order was missing the wonton soup that I paid for . But , I 'm not going to quibble with the mean Chinese lady over $ 2 .	
0	mh did this the last time i went to vegas in january . . i love the show so i was hoping for either a three d thing or something ANYTHING would 've been better than this . walking around here and there and looking at stuff ... not worth the money ... ... ... ... not worth the time ... ... . .	
1	This place is the best ! ! Everything is authentic and delicious . I could eat here everyday , the people who run it are very friendly and cool . Indian tacos and pop overs are bomb ! ! ! ! I give it 5 stars but id give it a million if I could . Every one should go here at least once or twice a week ! ! : )	
0	The beer selection is unique and delicious , but the service sucks . Just moved into the area tried to find a new local joint and tried this place a few times . Couldn 't get the time of day from bartenders on multiple occasions . Go to PT ' S if you 're looking for something in the area .	
1	Had to ship out a package , like any other post office . It 's a hit and miss with traffic in the parking lot , and lines to be served . Luckily , only had a few cars in the parking lot . Not that many people inside . Customer service was very helpful , and got me out very quickly .	
1	This place never fails ! Curry is amazing . I always get the red bean curry . The service is always fast and courteous . Perfect to sit in and done or to - go . Its BYOB so feel free to bring a beer or wine bottle .	
1	My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant ! Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food , the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca . We have always encountered friendly , welcoming staff and amazing , fulfilling food . What more could you ask for ? !	
0	Salad bar at 3pm was sad and wilted . The carrots were slimy and disgusting enough to scrap the salad and make a new one . Decent service and meal of crab cake ( dry ) and green beans ( overcooked ) . Generic , uninspired atmosphere . Sweet tea was syrupy . Wont be returning .	
1	I took all of the required brokers courses from Arizona School of Real Estate . Loved the classes and the instructors were great . All having many years of experience and bringing various aspects of real estate to the classes .	
1	I love the decor of this place . It has a contemporary Mexican feel . The food was delicious . We ordered the corn , queso , and tacos . Everything was delicious and very unique ... not the usual traditional Mexican food . I recommend it !	
0	this review was for the hypnosis show there were some parts that were funny , but overall it was TERRIBLE . can 't complain much since it was a free show for me , but i felt like i wasted my time sitting there . I 've been to a hypnosis show before at a college campus and it was highly entertaining .	
0	This review is for Tiffany W . , your comments to 1 - star reviews are simply ' cut and paste ' automatic replies that show a total lack of true sincerity . I simply hope you actually read the reviews and do something for the people that had bad experiences .	
0	It 's like a greasy Taco Bell , but slightly more expensive . If you want good mexican go to a real mexican restaurant . This is a chain and not a very good one . Nothing on the menu is remotely healthy except maybe the salads . Greasy chips , greasy tacos .	
1	Perfect size brown rice broccoli bowl was sooo good . Chicken and steak better than fast food places ... Plus the Customer service is amazing . They member your name and bring it to your table . PLEASE TIP THEM ! ! ! I 'll be back	
0	Guys watch your CASH , bartenders always try to rip you off . When they get a large $ 50 or $ 100 dollar bill they try to give you change for $ 20 . They treat you like crap . telling you : What do you want ? .	
0	This club was ridiculous ! Maybe it was because I came here on a Tuesday night , but it was such a waste of time coming here . My friends and I came here for my friend 's birthday but it wasn 't even crowded . The crowd was much older and we weren 't even allowed to go upstairs ! We stayed for like 10 minutes and left . I might consider coming back again . .	
0	Dirty store and poor quality clothing . Also , my thoughts when walking by the store are , were they blind when they hired their merchandiser ? 2 stories of cheaply made crap . I go for the tank tops , pajamas and cheap fashion jewelry .	
1	Dizzie was an AMAZING balloon artist and emcee for a very special 5th birthday party this past weekend . I look forward to hiring him over and over again ! Thanks Dizzie and see you soon - Mobile Make - Believe Events	
0	Very disappointed with brunch here . I ordered the Eggs Benedict . The eggs were overcooked ( cooked all the way through , no running yolk ) , and they used very little hollandaise sauce . If a restaurant with the word egg in its name cannot make a decent Eggs Benedict , you know it 's a bad restaurant . If the yolk doesn 't run , I run .	
1	This place has a good atmosphere and their crepes are wonderful . I recommend the tropical crepes , because the nutella crepes is too chocolately unless you are a big fan of chocolate . The chipotle crepes is really delicious and if you want coffee their hazelnut and mocha are good too .	
1	Great beer selection ! Sure , the menu is bar food , but give it a try - the burgers and the peanut butter flat bread dessert are delish ! We 've had issues with service but I enjoy the beer and atmosphere too much to care . : ) Oh - and the outside area is dog friendly !	
1	My Sunday ritual consists of sauntering into this establishment and doing the city paper crossword ( in pen and I can 't spell ) . Bummed they cut back the brunch menu but it is still a clutch brunch spot ( and it 's safely away from the masses lined up outside of Pamela eagerly waiting to get their fix of butter soaked everything with a side of afternoon diarrhea ) .	
1	I enjoyed The Sunday Brunch . The Lobster eggs Benedict , green New Zealand Clams , juicy duck meat , and white chocolate marshmallows . All are wonderful tasty treats . Overlooking the water fountains and exceptional personal service ; hats off to Chef Hiew : )	
0	Food was pretty good but the service was terrible . Server was unprofessional and came back after everyone had paid and asked for a better tip . I 've been in the service industry for 8 years and have never ever seen such a thing . Will not be returning .	
0	This place is really sucking tonight , and it 's a Saturday ! They got new bigger tv 's a while ago and of course raised the price of the theater . Tonight , as was last night no sound on any tv , watching porn with no sound , REALLY ! ! ! May as well go down the street to De Je Vue , bet they have sound !	
1	George is awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! We eat here all the time NEVER had bad food or bad service . The staff is great , friendly , and very patient . The food is always large portions ( we share a lot ) , delicious , and looks appealing . It 's a keeper in the go to place for us .	
1	Nice , fun place - good food . Waiters / bartenders are all friendly and attentive - really never had a bad experience in over a dozen visits . Big , clean , fun . Restrooms are big , clean . Can be bit too loud at times ( TV volume ) but it 's a really good place to go ... enjoy !	
0	Called them 4 times and left 4 messages . No return calls ! ! At least call me back and tell me you guys are very buzy . That tells me if I had any problems they won 't call me back anyways . Very disappointed !	
0	Do not trust these guys . When I put down $ 500 to buy a 2001 Mercedes 230SLK , it had four new Pirelli tires on it . During the purchase process , they had me sign something that said I was buying the car with the equipment it had on it , but when I picked it up , it had four mismatched , crappy tires . These guys would rip off their own mothers ! Buyer beware .	
1	Was a big fan of the lincoln park location in chicago , so to find the same menu , at similar prices with al fresco dining overlooking the bellagio fountains was a nice treat . The service was super fast , and the warm brie was superb .	
1	Change is always good when it comes to the seasons at Bellagio . They know exactly how to depict each season and make it enjoyable for all ages . They even have musical performances for the passersby . The best part about it is it 's free ! The displays usually move around or even talk . Definitely a place to stop by if you have some time on your hands .	
1	Like going home . I was raised in New York and I know deli . This place is the real deal . Great breakfasts , terrific soup and amazing sandwiches . The breads are fresh and everything tastes like home ! We came back three times while in Vegas even though we had to drive clear across the city . Warm , wonderful owners who are still excited about their trade . Just go !	
1	I 've lived in this area for so long and finally I went . This is the best Mexican food I ever had and they are nice and polite . The carne asada was high quality . The prices were just right . it 's just good . The beans had cheese in them and were great .	
1	This place is very friendly and relaxing . I 've been getting my lashes done by Emma since April and she 's the best ! I 've had my lashes done in the past at different salons and was not satisfied . Highly recommended !	
0	Food is average at best . Third time here and the peaks are the only attraction . Way better than hooters . Plenty of tv 's to watch the games . Great location . Don 't make a special trip for the food	
0	Do you know what is awesome ? When you make a reservation , arrive on time an have to wait over 20 mins for your table . That is completely unacceptable and unprofessional . And if they tell me it will be just a few more minutes because the table is being cleaned I am going to call them out on their bullshit lie ! ! !	
1	Ridiculously fabulous ! ! Seriously me and hubs came to check it out , however located inside the yard culinary dropout is this little hidden gem called little Cleo 's ... Wed night it is like a female hooters with all the hot guys that eye candied for me , jazzy music , fantastic food , we are in heaven . I 'll add pics !	
1	Great ! ! ! ! Ate there twice this week . The veal Milanese was like my Grandmothers and the pastafagoile the best in town ! The Italian cake for desert was light and sweet , a great desert . I 'm going back for more . The old school look is backed up by the authentic Italian cooking ! ! ! !	
0	Worst experience my boyfriend and I have ever had going out to eat . Food was cold and looked and tasted like it was all microwaved . Table and booth was dirty and sticky . If you want a quick but good breakfast definitely go to U . S Egg	
0	I 'd say 2 . 5 stars . Decent but odd dining room . Food is better than the looks of the place would lead you to believe . If you 're just interested in good food this place will fit the bill . If you 're looking for more of an experience then another place may be better suited for what you are looking for .	
1	I 've been going to McAuley Pediatrics for close to 9 years now . Both of my children like Dr . Collins as well as Dr . Gonzales . The office staff is friendly and will find ways to work you in if need be . As a plus they 're located right next to an evening only pediatric urgent care so if you can 't make it during the day you can go right next door at night .	
1	Fun stuff ! My raft flipped taking all 8 of us ( includes guide ) overboard . A few of us had some cuts from bumping up against the rocks . It would have been nice if the guide had directed us to the first aid area after we finished ... but we had to go find antibiotic ointment and bandaids on our own . Other than that , I 'd do it again .	
1	Rain shower , mood lighting , 55000 sq ft , extensive service menu , 3 hot tubs , 1 cold plunge , huge steam room and sauna , lots of drinks , no robe placed in warmer during treatment tho . Day pass only $ 26 . Enough said . Go , enjoy , be pampered .	
1	Lovely , serene , and everything I needed before I started my week of class . Go in the daytime when cooler weather , and go at night when hotter . They light up the place at night . I felt privileged to go when Chihuly glass displayed ( till May 2014 ) .	
0	This is my first yelp review . I 'm writing this review because : it 's not every day that you have your worst restaurant experience ever . Mine happened in this restaurant , Chinatown , Las Vegas . 1 . Dirty - I meant really nasty 2 . No service at all 3 . Foods are not good and expensive . DO NOT go to this restaurant ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	
0	Avoid Adore skin care products AT ALL COSTS . The products are highly allergenic , the sales techniques are very high pressure , and we were not told that the products were non refundable before purchase . This appears to be a SCAM . We were deliberately not given receipts that stated the refund policy . The only receipt we were given DID NOT state this policy . AVOI D ADORE .	
1	Mark was awesome in finding a time that he could fit us in so last minute . He was even a little early for our appointment . He did a great job , our carpets look almost new ! His prices are very reasonable and when it comes to a reliable trustworthy businessman , I would recommend Mark ! We will definitely being using him again in the future !	
0	I don 't understand how they are always out of beers on tap ! I live right across the street from this one and get bad service all the time . But I love to go to the hualapai one , the People are friendly and not rude !	
0	Pulling in and we were directed to a new lane opening up . But we ended up waiting for a half an hour in this new line . Horribly managed place . Apparently their equipment broke down . We ended up missing the beginning of the movie with no apology from them .	
0	Why are all our reviews being filtered or deleted ? Something is very wrong here and this needs to end ! If you are researching moon doggies rescue , make sure you click on the very bottom tab ( filtered ) there are about 10 reviews that were filtered with true stories regarding this company .	
0	It 's not for me . The Mac ' n cheese did not taste homemade or fresh and for me that is a big no - no in the South . The pulled pork had way too much black pepper for my preference . Too bad , I just moved close by and wanted this place to be our go - to place for dinner out .	
1	This restaurant serves really good mexican food at reasonable prices . The location and decor are great and make it look like a really expensive restaurant without the high prices . The service is almost always top - notch and prompt . My pick from the extensive menu would be the enchiladas .	
0	I 'm confused as to why this place has such a high rating . What I ordered was the most tasteless burrito I have ever eaten in my life . Not to mention the salsa was pretty bland as well . The wait staff was awesome though ! They smiled and they were really helpful . Part of the reason why I didn 't complain about the food while at the restaurant .	
1	We showed up after a Pirates game to keep the buzz rolling , and this place did the trick . 22 - ounce Yuenglings for $ 4 ? My kind of place . There were plenty of sports on the tellie , some really kickin ' alt rock music , and one of the friendliest crowds of all time . That adds up to a hell of a bar in my book .	
1	Vettes and Rods Car Club has a GREAT time at Rehab Burger Therapy this last Sunday ! Awesome food and AWESOME service ! We had at least 35 members there and we could not have had a better time ! MOST COOL ! And - I heard a few friends say I think we have found our new favorite place : - ) Thanks again for a great time !	
1	Why do people hate Jack so much . It is a fast food restaurant so don 't expect some sort of 5 star food or service . Any of their locations have been quick and accurate when I have went .	
0	Pizza it 's always good . However this place really needs an update or refurbishment on booths . And they had music playing overhead that was more annoying than anything ; lots of static . Music , static and kids tv noise doesn 't work ! Last but not least . Guy that took my order had Attitude Attitude Attitude .	
1	Quant bar / restaurant in downtown Tempe . I sat upstairs on the patio . Great view up there . The nacho fries is a must . Wouldn 't think these would be so good but you have to order these . The ceviche was good and it was taco Tuesday $ 1 tacos . These were very good as well ! Great place	
1	Love the decor and the girls ( a . k . a . servers ) are absolutely adorable ! My girlfriend 's kids love the California rolls and sliders ! We love the variety of udons ! Don 't forget to order the honey toast for dessert ! Definitely must save room in your tummy for that ! LOL !	
1	Didn 't go here for the food . But to get away from drama from another Resturant . Place was pretty kewl . Just drank two bottles of sojo in the late early morning with my girl friends . Before we all headed home ! More crazy karaoke happens at this spot too ! ! !	
0	It 's cheap pizza , what can you say . Nothing to write home about . I miss Gheppetos back home . PJ is like dominoes or Pizza Hut . Nothing to great . The bread sticks were pretty good though . Nice and soft .	
0	have not been there in a long time ... the guy taking the order was in some other world . the amount of pork or chicken on the sandwich has been reduced to almost half . the drinks are watered down . and the prices are up . Me thinks I wont be back there .	
1	Best pole dancing teacher around ! Hannah has a way of making you feel comfortable and ultimately confident in yourself . The way she approaches teaching is non intimidating . She is a super sweet girl with a contagious personality . I always leave her studio on cloud 9 !	
0	The quality of the food has really plummeted over the past year . We use to love coming her to get the creamy clam chowder , not its watery and gross . The nachos were awesome , now the cheese looks brown and disgusting . After 7+ years of coming regularly we likely won 't be back .	
0	Biggest rip - off company I have dealt with , and I have dealt with many . Not up front with fees and hit with way overpriced bill after job is done . I am a very dissatisfied customer , but last time for sure !	
0	I have been to this location multiple times before with okay results . However , lately my visits to this store have been a huge joke . There is never anyone on the sales floor and I have to go hunt someone down if I want to check out . Additionally , they used to have so much more of a selection . Don 't waste time or money here , go to a different store .	
1	This place is so wonderful ! The drinks are stiff and cheap . The bartender , Shannon , is amazingly awesome . She is friendly and will concoct anything you ask . It is typical dive bar food , like cheese crisps and burgers , but the prices are great and the salty food hits the spot when you are three sheets ... . Stop to check out this neighborhood spot and you will have a great time !	
0	Been a member since gym opened and it has just gone down hill . Kids throwing a football around the gym at the Entrance inside . Trainer 's having inappropriate conversation while on the clock . To bad it use to be a great place to work out .	
1	I 've been going to see Sarah for some time and she has always provided excellent service . She has done everything from cut and color to Brazilian blowout . I definitely recommend her to anyone looking for great salon service !	
0	I went to this restaurant for the first time in mid November , 2006 with friends . I think my expectations for the restaurant were too high because , the food was pricey but not worth the money . But on a good note , the service was attentive . If your looking for a place to be seen , its perfect . If your looking for excellent food for an affordable price , look elsewhere .	
1	THANK YOU CAIT ! Made my 21st birthday cakes just the way I wanted them ... I know I 'm 2 months late on a review but but better now then never ' thank you so much you did an amazing job on both the cakes . Next birthday in Vegas I 'll be calling you again . Best cake maker EVER !	
1	I 've been 3 times to Castello coffee . It has to be one of my first thoughts when recommending coffee to Italian visitors of ours . The coffee is excellent as is the service and the price is pretty good too !	
0	i think this place is overrated ... . the food is never that good and the staff is and alwas has been kind of blah ! avoid if ya can and save your money ... its not cheap for a sandwich shop ... . go next door to the next place	
1	Just wanted to highly recommend John at this location for those who get deep tissue massages . He was very thorough and my 90 minute massage was one of the best Ive ever had . Very professional and experienced !	
1	First time CHANG ' s . Went here from recommendation . Pork shobao was good . Attentive staff and multilingual ( Chinese , English and Tagalog ) . the congee was bland . The hargao was just ok . I would definitely come back .	
0	Literally the worst buffet I have ever been to . Went there for dinner the other night and everything was just terrible . Half the food was cold and the whole place smelled like old fish . Couldn 't even finish one plate of food , ended up going to get pizza elsewhere . Avoid at all costs .	
0	Tastes bad , food all seems processed , and my food was ordered and ready within 30 seconds - literally . At least hold onto my food for a few minutes to make me believe the food is fresh . Wouldn 't recommend , this is my first time here and I won 't ever be back .	
1	This is our new favorite place ! We have been several times over the past year and the food is always fresh and consistent . We went on Sunday , and they have expanded the seating area which made for an even better experience . Love this place !	
1	Unbelievable experience ! Just moved here from Chicago and my mom is a hair stylist . I 've always been very wary of getting my hair cut as I never had to pay for it . I was done up by Radi and he was absolutely amazing ! Attention to detail and precision were second to none . Best haircut in my life !	
1	First time trying Indian food , and I don 't think it could have been at a better place . I got the Dhaba chicken curry , and I really enjoyed it ! We also got the garlic and kashmiri naan , and both were delicious . I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff were all very friendly . Definitely a great experience !	
0	DONT BOOK A ROOM HERE . This place is disgusting , stains on the sheets , dirty bathroom , the floor in the room is stained and extremely dirty ... just don 't stay here ! ! ! ! ! !	
1	I really like this place . They have great combination meals . The fresh and crisp taste of the snap peas assures you that they just made your food when you ordered it . I am one of those people who goes in to pick up my food and doesn 't like to wait for delivery . They are fast and efficient , even if you walk in and order !	
0	Other than the decor , this over - priced , noisy taco joint lacks culinary appeal . Props to the service -- good and prompt . I ordered the three tacos and side combo . The tacos were salty and the fish was this side of bad .	
0	Our very presence in their lobby was an inconvenience to them . The manager was extremely rude when we asked for a table w out a reservation . No offer to wait just a blunt 45 min wait along with a snarky comment as we left do not take any more people with out a reservation . Thanks for the rude interaction were headed to Cheesecake Factory .	
1	I love that the place is clean , and the food is fresh . I have eaten their several times and the staff is very friendly . The shrimp are huge and wonderful . I 'm glad I stopped in and gave them a try .	
1	Most amazing time . Bar was fun and the happy hour prices were amazing . Love the decor and the employees all seemed to be having a great time . I even saw the a couple of employees joking and having fun with a darker skinned manager . It was a pleasure to see people enjoying their jobs .	
0	It 's a Friday , at midnight . The Vig Uptown has 4 stars on Yelp ... . . HOW COME THERE ' S NO ONE HERE ? ? ? Where is everyone ? Why is it so quiet ? I was very confused- it looks like a place where there should be a ton of people . But no , empty . Sad .	
1	Tried there shrimp kabobs with peanut sauce and was pleasantly surprised , they are juicy and tasty critters ! ! ! The Chicken pot - stickers are homemade and are the bomb with the zesty dipping sauce ! ! ! ! Flo you rock the House ! ! !	
1	First and only visit to a QT . The young lady at the register greeted me as I walked in . Nice . Very clean for a convenience store . I just don 't agree with the buy 2 drinks for $ 3 . 30 , but get 1 for $ 2 . I see it here , in Indiana and every where I 've traveled . Attentive service for the 5 minutes I was there .	
0	Very disappointing especially for the price ! Server was terrible . My food order was wrong so I had to wait for them to cook the meal I ordered while I watched my husband finish his food . Then when my dinner finally arrived I shoveled my food down because we both couldn 't wait to get out of there . Great date night . Won 't be going back .	
0	Really overpriced food ! I really wouldn 't mind the prices if the food was worth it , but my Brick Chicken was too dry and seriously wasn 't worth 24 dollars . The portion for that thing was too small . Go somewhere else to get better food in Vegas . Even when the place was empty the food took forever to come out !	
1	Best automotive experience I 've ever had . My car 's check engine light was on and instead of charging me an arm and a leg to fix a problem I might not have ( a new converter ) , they walked my car through the steps that led to the problem and fixed it ( a bottle of seafoam in my gas tank to clear out my sensors ) . They were friendly , helpful and fair .	
1	I 'm a regular during the lunch hour , food is always prepared quickly with quality and the customer service is great . My only comment with be the portion of meat you receive in salads or rice bowls , other than that it 's definitely a great spot for lunch in the area .	
0	I went here on a Thursday afternoon when it wasn 't really busy and the vibe I got from the employees was that they really disliked their job . I have been here numerous times and its the same thing every time . I also got sick from the food this time which prompted me to write about it . I think I will try avoiding this place from now on .	
1	I really enjoy this location . Service can be hit or miss but I prefer it over all of the other locales . Pros : Vegetarian friendly Food is consistantly delicious Outdoor seating , weather permitting Spacious with upstairs seating Clean Cons : Service ( see above )	
1	The Outdoor pool is a must do for the summer if you live in Vegas . It 's great for children and even adults . The only down side is that there is limited loungers and chairs . If you don 't get there early you 'll be sitting on the ground . Still full for all ages .	
1	Went last weekend for the first time . Family had a ton of fun . Daughter loved the kid slides . A few staff could be a little more attentive at the slides , but the majority were great ! Looks like the park could use a few cosmetic updates , but will def return again !	
1	Aqua Touch is one of the few retailers that I frequent to stock and replenish my salt water system . I go here because the store is always impeccable , they have an incredible selection of fish / coral/inverts that are always good looking , healthy and priced reasonably . I come here to stock up on pre - mixed water and frozen fish food . Aqua Touch I am a big fan !	
0	I have gone to this place for years and USED to really love it . I still love the atmosphere , but the food has gone WAY down hill . If your looking for great decor , friendly staff and poor food this is your place . Seems that they are resting on their fame now only .	
1	Stopped at brickhouse while visiting Madison for the first time . There was a great selection of Wisconsin beers on tap . We ordered the catfish sandwhich which was delicious and also tried the pulled pork sandwich which was great too . Our server was friendly and helpful . Very pleased and would definitely recommend !	
0	This place was terrible ! ! ! They took over 15 minutes to get the food . . We ended up leaving after paying without the food because they weren 't wearing gloves and kept touching lifting up their pants ! I will never eat at this place ever again ! !	
1	Despite getting locked in a shower and the slow and uninspired tea service , my time at Qua was perfection . I took my best friend here the day before her Vegas wedding and we both had wonderful spa experiences with the day pass . It was ideal because we had plenty of time to chat and relax . Of course , if I wanted total silence and privacy , I might go elsewhere .	
1	I had so much fun at Tavern 51 ! The drinks prices were very reasonable . The bartender was fun and attentive . They have a great patio out back . The decor is nice and the place could not be cleaner !	
0	This place was empty came here twice . Mabe 2 groups at the most were in here . Ultra high prices Hookahs cost 20 to 30 dollars its nuts . They don 't smoke that great and the guy working there was a little creepy he would pop up all over the place . The prices where just outrageous there 's palace in summerlin that 's way cheaper and nicer . I would npt recommend this place .	
1	After eating the kobe burger , don 't know if I want to eat burger elsewhere . Definitely a must go place if you are in Vegas and tired of all the buffet places . I had the kobe burger with portobello mushroom and it was just heavenly ... moist and melts in your mouth goodness and not greasy at all ! ! ! ! Sweet potato is a very good side .	
1	Food : good ! Chicken and waffles and potatoes . Great portions and decent prices . Service : good for as busy as they are . Atmosphere : looks good but it is soooooo busy all the time and the wait sucks ! ! ! We love this place but you have to be patient . Expect a 45 minute wait .	
1	They take great care of our pets here . We rarely have much of a wait , and all of the staff are courteous and talented in handling and caring for pets . All of the vets we have met with were professional , friendly , and very capable .	
1	This is a fantastic salon because the 2 owners work together with their 2 assistants . It is small and they cater to you as an individual . They show respect and are not high up on their horses . They listen to what the customer wants and suggest what they think would work best for the client 's hair . They are both exremely talented stylists and colorists .	
0	Dear Lord ... who has been reviewing this place ? Went there for their quote unquote BEST CRAB ... . more like crap . They are small legs of crab , cut in half , as dry as jerky and there was something gritty on them . SERIOUSLY ? Place is nice enough looking - service was personable , but the food was not worth the price of admission . I worry that this restaurant YELPING is fixed .	
0	Walked in , awkwardly sat myself after no one greeted me . Waitress came and took my order ( a beer ) , and then I sat there for about 15 minutes watching her serve everyone around me . Finally just walked out . Not sure if anyone even noticed . So , yeah ... that happened .	
0	We went for breakfast and it was okay , edible I suppose . Especially considering we were up all night partying . Everything we got was cold , especially the eggs . I did like they had different breakfast sauasages . We got the $ 32 pass to eat here and at excalibur buffet all day . Great deal even if you only going to eat there 2 times that day .	
0	Such a bad ass restaurant . DO NOT GO HERE ! ! If they say the waiting time is 10 minutes it is for at least for an hour . If you try to make a complain of their information they will say how the hell do I know when they leave ? They think they are serving you for a free . They will treat you like a dirt .	
1	I 'm all about the Watering Hole at this location ! James , the beer guru , is awesome , friendly and a true beer encyclopedia . Have a couple of beers , taste a sampler , grab a bite from any of the food counter , any way you do it , your mouth will be happy .	
1	AAA rate was $ 179 AND it was on NYE weekend too . Great price , free breakfast , free cocktails at 530pm . about a mile away from Wynn and Venetian but the walk is nice along the Wynn golf course . Get a room facing south and you will be rewarded with a view of the strip . One more thing avoid rooms near the elevators because they may bother you .	
1	Great place to go eat and listen to music . Ive been here a couple of times and the food and service was awesome , recently came to watch the world cup game and had a blast i definitely recommend this place whether to eat watch a game or just spend time with family .	
0	Went there on a whim . Very disappointing . I thought the food was expensive and gross . Slow service . The guacamole wasn 't anywhere near to what I can make in 1 minute at home . The chicken tacos were gross .	
0	Had been looking forward to eating there . Was greeted by the woman at the counter , shown to a table , waited 15min then told the wait for pizza was 40 . Server offered to call ahead to other location while we drove . There was no call . See other review for part 2 . Poor planning on a busy evening .	
0	Crappiest PetSmart ever ! The grooming department returned my ( extremely short haired Boxer ) smelling about as bad as I left him . Awful customer service , dirty , & shelves are rarely stocked correctly . You 're better off going somewhere else if you can . It 's so bad locally that I 've looked into ordering the food online and having it delivered to my door .	
1	Not Only do they make the absolute best donuts and pastries in the whole metro area the couple that own and run the business exemplify the meaning of American small business ! ! Go there now . Spend all your money ! ! ! ! Be happy all day ! ! ! ! ! !	
0	Nothing special . Probably 4 stars if you 're drunk late at night . Funny how that improves just about any restaurant . If you 're a tourist looking to try a classic Quebec poutine you should look elsewhere for the magical experience .	
1	I decided to try this location again on 8 / 24 and unlike the first time everything was very good from the start to the end . My server Ryan was very friendly and polite . Beer was very cold and my food was delicious . i love their calamary ! My friend tried Lobster tacos and they were awesome ! I enjoyed my visit very much !	
1	Great ambiance at this vegetarian / vegan restaurant ! First saw it on Instagram while looking for healthy places to eat while traveling from Seattle to Tempe ! The staff and owner were friendly and attentive and our two dishes were excellent ! ! Fairly priced at $ 10 or under and quality and amount of food is a great value ! We are coming back for brunch ! !	
1	Best RA location in AZ . Always get great service and great sushi consistently . I can 't say that for the Scottsdale locations . Also can 't beat the happy hour deals and the specials when you join their loyalty club . One more perk - they are the only place you can find Orion for your sake bomber instead of Kirin , etc .	
1	I eat here all the time with my girlfriend and we can 't say enough about this place ! Amazing decor , service , and cuisine ! She loves the Thai ice tea and veggie pad Thai and I always get the chicken pad Thai or duck basil . Amazing quality and variety .	
0	Probably the most pathetic place I have ever been . Bouncers think that being a bouncer is really important . Getting inside is like accomplishing absolutely nothing . Nothing to see . Nothing to do . Guys with big egos and small ... . Go somewhere else .	
1	Fantastic cherry - peach turnover . Freshly made and Oh . My . God . so good . Great little place , some tables outside which was lovely in August , when I was last there . Busy , so we got there early and were lucky enough to get a nice spot outside . Fantastic breakfast and will definitely be back next time I 'm in Madison .	
1	Hands down the vegan donuts are amazing the only negative is that I wish the carrot cake donut was way bigger : ) The s ' more donut that was awesome along with the mayan and Mexican chocolate spice . . Taylor was very helpful with all questions we had and made us some great coffee ! ! ! ** check out the wallpaper in the bathroom pretty cute We will definitely be returning to O Face ...	
1	it was my second time around and i 'm so happy my memory didn 't fail my tastebuds . for all you san franciscans , it 's a cha cha cha ' s - like restaurant kicked up some notches . more selection , fantastic sangria and great portions for a excellent price .	
1	The Pink Spot is definitely my new spot for ice cream . I got an amazing brownie sundae there and it took me two days to eat it ! They also offer frozen bananas , which makes me feel like I 'm at a Bluth Banana Stand ( a la Arrested Development ) . AND ! They deliver !	
1	It 's so beeeeyooootiful ! I loved it here ( and I really , really liked the sheer lotus curtains in our room ) and loved how it was close enough to xs to just walk indoors there , but far away enough so you didn 't have to hear all the noise if you didn 't want to .	
1	I 've become a regular here ... I love how fresh everything tastes . My usual is a berry blast smoothie , Roasted garlic hummus with extra pita bread and a prima grilled cheese without tomatoes as I 'm picky about how my tomatoes are cut This place had met my expectations repeatedly , a definite go to .	
0	This review isn 't directed at this specific store but at CenturyLink as a whole . This is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with for any type of service . I have had them for residential and dropped them due to their terrible customer service and horrific internet service .	
1	Stopped in for some coffee last week and have been every weekday since . Everything I 've had here is good . Would pick this place over Starbucks any day of the week . So far I 've tried the Raspberry Mocha and peanut butter Mocha , both awesome !	
0	Overpriced and skimpy on quantity . This was , by far , the worst cheesesteak I 've ever had . The sandwich , fries , and drink was almost $ 15 ! ... and this is a restaurant in a mall food court , no excuse it should be that much . The portion if meat you get is sad , just sad . I 'll stick with trusty cappriotis .	
1	Local - international gathering spot since the 1940s . One of the coolest pubs on the planet . Make new friends from all over the world , with some of the best regional and imported beer selections in town .	
1	We are now addicted to rock fish . The first bite leaves your mouth swimming in a silky fish in a light soy sauce . Ok so we ate 5 hours ago and are jonesing for more . On a more traditional taste Chow fun noodles with black beans sauce and beef . Or the salt and pepper pork chops . Wonder how they will reheat ! !	
1	Great morning shift staff , there is one lady here who actually memorized my name after a couple visits . And after not going for a while I showed back up and she still remembered me . Great people to talk to and easy service . Juice is a tad watery	
1	I eat lunch here at least once a month . Service is always great . Some of the friendliest in Las Vegas . Great fish n chips , great mac n cheese ... and try the grilled artichoke if you like them , you will love it . One of my favorite places . I 'd like to see more choices on the menu , but all in all , this is a great place .	
1	The best burger joint in the whole country , I ordered the damnation chicken burger with chocolate smoothie , I did not have any burger taste in my mouth like that . the Parmesan truffle fries . it is pricey but it 's worth it . I tried Jack in the Box and Sonic but nothing like Gordon Ramsay burger . his a tip for two people to order your own burger and drink and share order of fries .	
0	Not busy , and horrible service . Barely any TVs to watch football , unless you like 20 screens . Went to the restroom and it was trashed with garbage everywhere . And very over priced , along with not a lot of food selection . Good luck	
1	I ve been living here for a year and have faced no problems at all . The apartments on the penthouse floor which is the 22nd floor are great . You have an option of choosing an apt with new appliances which are much better than the really old ones . The maintainence staff and the office are always available and helpful . I did have some problems with the dishwasher and the kitchen sink but it was fixed .	
0	Nah . I forked over $ 13 for a club sandwich , mac ' n ' cheese , and a large Pepsi . The mac ' n ' cheese was good , and the sandwich was just okay . I say take your $ 13 and go to Texaz Grill ! ! ! WAY better food , and for $ 13 you can get dessert too .	
1	I like going to a stylist to get my hair cut and Kristy is the best to go too ! ! She has a $ 5 off men 's cuts on Wednesdays and that 's when you 'll find me there ! !	
0	Total GARBAGE ! Head waiter has a serious attitude . Looked down his nose at me when I asked for white wine . Stated , we don 't serve blush wines real snotty . Ordered food and it was cold plus there wasn 't enough there to feed a bird . Stay away people , just avoid this crap .	
1	I brought my cat here having trouble finding someone to work with my schedule and Helen went out of her way to do my cat and she did a wonderful job and now I take my doggie here to love this place they are really nice and great customer service	
1	( 7 / 8/13 ) Individual cupcakes get individual containers ! What a great concept . I had been dreading a larger box that would get tossed around by my driving & destroying both the cupcake & the frosting . I bought a lemon cupcake on this visit . It was perfection .	
0	Three times is my limit for this over hyped , over priced , non unique , and non delicious place . I don 't know why so many people recommend it . Its genuinely non special and non memorable . And they charge you extra for tofu even though its replacing meat in the dish . And I got three tiny slivers of tofu in my curry last night . Boring and overpriced .	
1	These guys are great ! They saved my butt . I needed to have a full tank of fuel drained down to one quarter tank to take the F150 into the convention center . Not as easy as it sounds !	
0	After reading these reviews , I probably went on an off day . I got the pretzel sticks and lemonade . The pretzel was undercooked and tasted like a warm dinner roll with salt and the lemonade was really watered down . Had a much better pretzel in the bread basket at Mastro 's later that night .	
1	I absolutely adore Chelsea 's Kitchen ! Super comfy ambiance , delectable food , inventive flavors , a seasonal selection of wild seafood and natural meats , and an extremely friendly staff . What more could you ask for ? Delish !	
0	It was okay I 've been there before in California . I think this 1 is a little different for me sometimes depends on the location but I didn 't really enjoy it Planet Hollywood . Get customer service but other than that I didn 't really enjoy the food there . If it is a next time maybe I should try the 1 in Green Valley .	
0	Having gone to the Studio B , Bellagio , and Rio 's buffets , I would say : Spend the extra money . The ambiance is good , but the food is so - so . Not many choices in terms of meat , especially during lunch . The fruits weren 't that fresh . Not one of the better buffets on the strip ( the only one I can think of that 's worse is Excalibur )	
0	Not sure . Walked in ; place looked semi - deserted . Sat down , waiter brought our drinks , then 20 minutes later we left without ordering . Seems like a depressing out of the way place now that everything else has been built up so much around it . Again , a sad state of affairs in the local economy .	
1	A warm homey place , nice owner . Food was well prepared . Not a wide variety of pastas , in fact , the menu was verbally told to me by the owner/ chef . Overall , a good experience .	
1	Last week - tire was low . Pulled into Gunnells at 7 : 30am ( they open at 7 : 30am ) Out by 07 : 55am thanks Gunnell Family for always being there . Nick from Sweet Cakes Cafe , Mesa , AZ	
0	Horrible service ! ! ! I didn 't even get to eat . Lady acted like she was in drugs . She saw me taking my time and she totally walked away saying this isn 't worth my time . Idk id she had a bad day or something but I walked right out and don 't really care for it that much . There 's plenty of sushi places out there	
1	I was visiting my house here in Surprise this week from Washington , DC . Found this place on Yelp , and I am very impressed with the service and especially the pizza . I have been looking for a great place to go that was near my house and this is the place .	
0	The midtown location continues to disappoint with their lack of customer service ! We sat for 15 minutes waiting for a server and when she arrived she was not at all apologetic . In fact she asked if we needed more time when we hadn 't even gotten water ! ! Then the food took forever ... how long does it take to cook 2 eggs over easy ! ! Last time I 'm coming here ! !	
1	I went Monday and I love going after work . I got my eyebrows waxed and a fresh gel overlay . I had to soak off the acrylic off my nails . The technician actually took the time to do and didn 't damage or hurt my nail beds like other salons do . My nails came out perfect and I 'm happy . I 'll be returning again .	
1	The beer was great , as was Matt . Well worth seeking out . Do the sampler , something for everyone . Don 't need to dress up , but bring the girls down . They will find a beer they will love .	
1	Stuck in a little strip mall , which seems typical for the area . Nice ambiance given that . The staff was delightful and helpful , and the panang curry was excellent , as was the Thai iced tea and the Thai tea ice cream . I would definitely return and recommend .	
1	i really like this part of town ... the sams clubs are always busy though ... its best to go in the morning because after the afternoon the lines start getting long ! and people in line have alot of item so you can imagine just how long it takes ! overall everything seems clean and they have a great freindly staff ...	
1	Hands down best place in town for authentic Eastern european food . I can gladly say that the only food that can compete with my Babushka 's home made pelmenies would be the ones served at La Caverne . I even brought my aunt when she came from Ukraine and she absolutely loved it . Would recommend to everyone .	
1	Shortly after my plane landed we headed to Chompie 's because we saw the Man vs . Food challenge . We ordered the Reuben sandwich to split and a Jewish slider . Man was it enough food . The classic reuben was delicious to say the least . Pretty sure I had the best fries I 've ever had as well . The slider was very very good Please go to Chompie ' s .	
1	You want New York pizza ? Go to New York . You want the best New York pizza in Arizona ? Go to Venezia ' s . Yes this family run shop was featured in Breaking Bad , and they have shops in AZ and NM . This pizza is better than any other pizza place that claims to have New York pizza . Trust me , I 'm a New Yorker .	
0	I ordered just a regular old burger that was nothing special and quite frankly over priced . I wasn 't too impressed with the live music they had playing . Also expected the atmosphere to be a little more fun and excited . Probably won 't be back .	
0	Terrible service and food . Really disappointing . Other Arribas are great . Waitress had a festering , scab tattoo that almost made me sick . Would 've left if I noticed it earlier . Should 've called health dept	
0	This is a very bad McDonald ' s . They serve dried out sandwiches on stale bread that 's been sitting around for too long . When made fresh and properly prepared , McDonald 's food is delicious . What this restaurant does to McDonald 's is a disgrace and I wish the corporation would deny franchises to investors who buy these restaurants and leave unmotivated unprofessional morons to run them .	
0	Dive bar filled with perverts and heroin addicts . Looks like an Intervention Convention . Bartenders are weathered and bitter . Food tastes bad and they charge way too much considering they are a dive bar and not a nightclub .	
0	Just had their chocolate chimp smoothie and it was probably one of the worst things I 've ever tried . There was no way I thought this was how it was supposed to taste so I asked to remake it . Tried it again . It went from unedible to horrible ! ! ! ( Guess that 's an upgrade ) Never trying this place again .	
0	I 'm not sure how this place has a 4 . 5 star average rating . The beer is solid . The brewery atmosphere is standard . The night I was there it had a lot of screaming kids running around . The food is not a reason to go there . We ordered their most popular items and they were nothing special .	
0	Being from the Midwest , I 'd never had Del Taco . Can 't really say I 've missed anything : the bag probably had more flavor than the cold , limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all - lettuce chicken tacos .	
1	I love Mexican food & I have been to many different places & I never thought I 'd say this but this is definitely the best place I 've ever been too ! It 's my new favorite . The staff are so friendly & nice & the food is great ! Will definitely be going back !	
1	Awesome experience here . Chocolate chip pancakes were great , homemade muffin fantastic and amazing service . Waitress offered to grab us to - go drinks and food was out within 10 minutes of ordering ( even with the restaurant full ) . Great dinner feel and exceptional service . Highly recommend .	
1	The scallops appetizer are AMAZING , actually everything was amazing . The food and service were great , no complaints . The atmosphere was very nice as well . It is a great date spot to take that special someone . I recommend trying this place if you have not already !	
0	This is supposed to be a non - smoking hotel , but they let guests smoke on the balconies . Second - hand smoke is sucked into the through - the-wall air conditioning units and your room smells like smoke . There is nothing management can do except give you a free breakfast , if you complain . Sad .	
1	Cool spot right next to the Wisconsin State House , where I found myself for business . Loved the bar , which had a funny hipster vibe . Had a cocktail made from their house jam that was great . The snapper brodetto was good too . I 'll go back next time I 'm in Wisconsin just for the cocktails .	
0	BORING ... It 's one of those very chic shopping venues that is sterile and dull with all the same shops you can see at any high end mall . I 'd rather walk around the TL in San Francisco . It 's more interesting .	
0	Stopped here for breakfast one morning during our recent stay in Vegas . Food was average as were portions , decent enough but nothing special . Wait staff was ok , nothing special . Doubt I would repeat going here again . Breakfast for four was 65 . 00 .	
1	I am sorry but this place is so good . It is super large inside and the staff is always friendly / helpful . My fav is the bento box , it is about $ 8 . They also have student deals and a water cooler with glasses next to the counter if you do not want soda . Cool and relaxing place .	
1	It 's popcorn , so I didn 't really expect too much . My girl was adament about trying this place last weekend , so I obliged . I went with the caramel almond flavor and we demolished the bag really fast . My girl got a spicy and sweet flavored one that was really good , but just almost a little too spicy . I 'd come back , if I 'm in the area .	
1	Nightclub review : Love the music , love the multiple rooms , and love the people that go there to have a good time . Staff is friendly and helpful and there to make sure you have a good time . The place is visual overload and Grand Central Station for over - stimulation ( feel free to use that in your marketing collateral ) . Nice work , Marquee , you 'll have us back very soon .	
0	Worst service ever ! The bar tender was soooo rude . It 's not my business if you enjoy your job , but the least you can do is fake it ! Cold food , rude service ... With so many choices in the area I will go else where for sure .	
0	Great bartenders . Tight machines . Players benefits going downhill . Must leave all VIP dinner food at restaurant . No take home on leftovers . VIP dinners aren 't so VIP . Non VIP customers treated better . Shrimp dinners are a joke .	
0	Garbage , do not waste your money . The bo bo platter had gummy beef skewers , fried chicken skewers wsy over cooked , and mushy flattened shrimp that looked like they were beaten like an inmate . The chicken chop suey had chewy chicken , a few veggies , too much sprouts , and canned mushrooms . This slop sucks .	
1	Our first time for supper . The service was excellent , atmosphere casual elegant and beautiful views of the city and mountains . My husband had a delicious Beef Stroganoff with fresh homemade noodles and light creamy sauce . I had Sea Scallops on a bed of fresh risotto with lemon aioli . We 'll be back !	
0	This place is shady as . fuck . they tried to . over charge on bottles and some stripper hoes falsely advertised their price . The girls here are nothing special . Vegas is way better . Im fat and ugly but still not impressed . Avoid these shaddy aholes	
0	Open 24 / 7 ... We usually come here earlier during the night but this time i just got off from work and was craving some vietnamese sandwiches ... The service was very slow and they messed up on my order twice ... Its a new lady that took my order ... Was rude ...	
0	This review is for breakfast only . Unbelievably bad breakfast . Wobbly table , bad service , had to ask for salt , pepper , napkin and silverware . Cream for coffee was old and curdled , sausage was disgusting , eggs not the way I ordered them . Coffee lousy too . I recommend you eat anywhere but here for breakfast . Seemed like cafeteria food .	
0	Service was great but food was disappointing . Pork belly was too greasy and my short ribs were way too sweet . Mashed parsnips were sickly sweet with an odd aftertaste . The fries with the lamb burger had a strange texture . I don 't think they used the right potatoes . I really wanted to love this place from all the great reviews but am truly left disappointed .	
1	The party starts as soon as you get off your plane . Slot machines all over the airport . Either go broke or win before you get to your hotel . It was very easy to navigate in McCarran . Everything was marked so you shouldn 't get lost or anything . It was easy to catch a shuttle as well .	
1	A good amount of good food for a good price . The seating is limited to approx 5 big tables which seat 6 each . I ordered a # 11 combination meal which included a hearty amount of beans and rice along with an enchilada and tamale for $ 5 . 99 . Their menu is huge though and contains many distinctive Mexican dishes that I 've not heard of but I 'm sure are delicious .	
0	Absolutely terrible . All hype , no delivery . Meat was dry and bland , service was rude , don 't know why people would wait over an hour for a sandwich that deserves zero recognition . AVOID - and thank me later	
0	It is bad in every way possible . We called and asked if they were busy and they hung up , VERY expensive for low quality food , half the orders came out after everyone else was done eating , the salad was literally half a cup of chopped lettuce ...	
0	The restaurant was empty when we went . It was kind of cool , felt like I reserved the whole restaurant for me and my lady . I am giving this place 2 stars because the food was OK . But the place looks dirty and there was a roach crawling on my seat .	
1	We have been bringing our pets here for about 6 years now . They are always very friendly , go over all possible options when it comes to healing your sick pets and don 't try to push any unwanted services on you .	
0	Ra . Is Blah And the peeps . Give me the creeps . Service ? Makes me nervous . The vibe . Just don 't jibe . Just not my scene . I 'm a picky queen . Don 't like the snotties . Acting all haughty . Sake bombers cheap and good . Only reason I would . Go to Ra . Blah Blah Blah .	
1	Really amazing service , very helpful & certainly affordable . The owner tray really cares & makes sure everything is to your liking . My Lexus Ls went from blackcherry to candy apple , matching rims . . detailed & clean for pick up . . very professional , I recommend this company , & pleased with their work . . Thank you for your outstanding service ! ! ; )	
0	The only good thing about Secret Pizza is the location and the name . Pretty creative to called themselves secret and not have signs or direction to this place . I was not impressed by the pizza at all . It wasn 't bad , just average .	
1	Best Happy hour 3 - 7 Mon - Sat and get the 22oz Kirin and small sake for $ 7 . 75 . Salmon carpaccio was nice and Vegas roll . Can 't go wrong with the tuna Tataki and rainbow roll for $ 7 . 75 each during HH .	
1	The prices are a little high . . But they do have a good lunch special , you get a personal pizza a side salad , and a drink for $ 8 . I have been here 3 times now and everything has been good ! No complaints !	
0	I may not be back like previously stated . The last two times I got take out food , the chips tasted like they had been cooked in rancid oil and the salsa was waaay too salty . It pains me to say this place has really gone downhill from what it once was . I haven 't been back in a long time .	
1	This was a great cafe . Had the bone in rib eye steak cajun style . Great flavor and cooked just right . Had the sliders to start . Great service at 1 : 30AM . It was a good meal at a fair price .	
0	So not impressed . It 's gone downhill from when they opened . Today it broke half way through and the dude wouldn 't let me go back through . ALSO . THERE IS ALWAYS A SMALL DIRT STREAK LEFT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR . something isn 't right with that .	
0	I 've eaten at here 15 -20 times since late 2009 or 2010 . In the beginning , the food quality was excellent then it was sold or under went management change , I can remember the advertisement flyer . The last several times ordering take out has unacceptable in quality , this is not a place I 'd recommend now .	
0	By far , the least impressive Cirque du Soleil show I have seen . The performers are all amazing , but for some reason , it was not showcased or directed well . We spent over $ 130 on each ticket , and we had excellent seats , which were very comfortable , But the show seem to drag on . The sand artist was really cool and different .	
0	I am updating this review rating as the General Manager contacted me directly , so am appreciative of the outreach . Has anyone else tried ? Let me know if I was way out of line with my review .	
0	Baristas aren 't the friendliest , and for the price , their drinks aren 't the best . For around $ 4 I got a medium -which was pretty small- iced coffee that tasted like a watery Starbucks iced coffee with TOO much ice , there were seriously only three sips .	
0	Selection was limited and the styles were all ghetto . The worst part is that the salespeople are rude and don 't even bother to greet me when I 'm standing right in front of them and they didn 't even have any other customers there ! ! !	
0	This place is really close too me but unfortunately not good at all . Wanted some frozen yogurt but didn 't want to drive to yogurt land so I decided to try this place . Next time I 'm in the mood for yogurt I 'll drive a little further . Granola was so salty , cherries were so bitter !	
1	I have been going here since I was a kid , best donuts ever ! Crumb donut is amazing , but all of their donuts are good , they have donut holes , thai tea and coffee drinks . The same people have been working here for as long as I can remember .	
1	I love this place ! I recently started going and its great ! I even love the lazy cat that lounges around ! ( secretly I check to make sure its still alive ) - but all in all , love it !	
1	The first time I stayed at South Point was in mid of 2006 , not long after they grand opened . It was very clean , large rooms , nice staff and not to mention the price ... . Have been a fan ever since thenthough their price has doubled since then too ... : )	
0	Service at this Denny 's was dismal . After waiting for 45 mins for breakfast at 10am , the manager didn 't even apologize for the food coming late . Food was mediocre . Location was pretty sketchy . Only go to this location if your desperate .	
1	Matt is very attentive . He has lots of patience , and seems to be more into the customer service side of things than sales . I ended up purchasing more product because he was so helpful . Cool cat for sure . Their product seems to taste less synthetic than other e juice I 've purchased from other stores .	
1	Food is consistently good . We often go for weekend brunch . I 'm from NJ , which has a lot of 24 hour diners . This is one of the only places in Madison that offers breakfast all day , so it 's great in my book . Don 't come if you mind long lines or kids ; do come if you like yeasted doughnuts !	
1	I really like this place a lot . The employees seem to really care and every time I leave with a spotless car . Nice , friendly people and the prices are right . Can 't really ask for more . Very satisfied customer .	
1	Simply Lovely and Unique ! We enjoyed all the unique oils and vinegars they offer . Very relaxing place to stop and shop a little and have a bite to eat . Get some fresh baked olive bread and enjoy with some amazing olive oil and specialty vinegars .	
1	We have always loved Oreganos , but my wife was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy . Many pizza places in the valley now have gluten free crust options . Oreganos , please get with the times and add a gluten free crust option ! !	
1	Had a great breakfast of chicken , gravy , and biscuits with 2 over easy eggs buried under the chicken . Very tasty and not greasy at all . My friend had a mushroom omelet which she said was very good . Good coffee . Very busy early ( before 10 AM ) on Sunday and there was a 30 minute wait , but good , prompt service once we were seated	
0	Mmmmm ... . If you can get past the musty and damp carpet smell ( prob from the lake humidity ) , the food is pretty decent ! ! ! ! Hey Buster ' s ! Replace your carpet for Pete 's sake ( and clean it frequently once you do ! )	
0	I can only give it to stars . I was so disappointed we ordered sandwiches for delivery they were very nice and the delivery man was very friendly and they were fast . The bread was horrible . my last time ordering from there .	
0	If you 're at the hospital and want something other than hospital food , this place may be the ticket . Right across the street , you can get a good variety of food . It 's quick and easy and not too expensive . Just don 't go for the atmosphere because , well , there isn 't much . But keep your head down and that won 't matter much .	
1	Spread the word about this place because it is DELICIOUS ! The staff is always so welcoming and friendly . I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a quiet lunch or dinner . The only thing that I think goes against The Nile is the location . This place should move downtown to increase their customers . Will always come here !	
1	I finally found a nail salon I like ! Joanne did a fill for me after a disappointing set from another salon . She was meticulous and made sure each nail was right on BOTH sides and also not too thick . This will be my new nail salon .	
1	Great food and excellent service . Love the location . Be sure to mk a reservation , esp if you want to sit on the patio . We were seated in the sunroom which was actually better bc we were protected from the hot sun and this was in October ! I 've eaten here several times and at the location in DC . Very good choice for the $	
1	This is a gay bar which I didn 't realize for the longest time . The drinks are good and cheap and it 's very pretty with the big tree , centrally located and always has a big crowd .	
1	Really fantastic service and quality food . We had the short ribs ( amazing taste with carrot sauce ) , drinks , the Buffalo sirloin and the Ravioli . Everything was seasoned to perfection and the drinks were good . The waiter was polite and the ambiance was really calm and welcoming . Really a good value .	
1	We have been twice . Both times the food has been excellent and tasty , with fresh ingredients . I have had seafood both times and been very pleased with the quality and preparation . ( cioppino is very good ) Reasonably friendly staff with decent service . My only complaint was that the waitress this last time really had no knowledge of the wine list and that was really a bummer .	
1	I 've gone to the Mane twice and have been happy with both haircuts . I 've had two different people cut my hair and it seems like everyone there has lots of experience . The only thing I wasn 't totally satisfied with was the straight razor shave . It wasn 't terrible but I 've had better .	
1	One of my favorite spots in Vegas . I have had several great meals here . The Sommelier was fantastic , friendly and made some really great pairings . If you 'd like a tasty fun cocktail , try their cable car . Again , Michael Mina can do no wrong by me .	
1	This hotel is really nice , but it 's mostly for the over 40 crowd . The restaurants are great , though . I stayed for 4 nights and could not have been happier with the room accommodations or the friendliness of the staff . However , if you don 't take Centrum and you want to go balls out Vegas crazy I recommend the Hard Rock .	
0	I hope there was a good reason for Steve to flake on his appointment for window tinting . Attempted to contact him multiple times with no answer and no return call . Waited in the heat for a half hour outside his shop on Valley View before giving up .	
1	I am satisfied with the work that they have done for me on framing my very oversized medical diploma and framing canvas prints that I have actually bought for a deal in this place . Rock on ! ! !	
0	Everyone looks for that little hole in the wall that turns out to be a gem in the rough . This isn 't it . it 's closer to rough than gem . Food is iffy at best . Service is borderline . They have good hours and the chips are relatively fresh so all is not a loss .	
0	We went to the location to purchase a bow tie and the store was closed early , which was less than ideal because we specifically hurried over there for an urgent need . We ended up going back the next day , and the attendant was very helpful . But closing the store earlier than posted hours leaves me to leave only two stars on this review .	
1	Small tiffany 's but has a great selection . They were so nice . They did a quick cleaning of one of my rings and it sparkles like new again ! I had to wait a few to get some service to get some earrings because most of the employees were up in the front helping people with the diamonds , where I was just buying silver	
1	After a poor experience at the verizon store on maryland parkway , i went to this store . They fixed me up , got me into a better plan , and were clearly on the ball . Nice people too .	
1	My husband and I just moved back to Ahwatukee and tried ALL the frozen yogurt places in the area ! Yoasis is by far and away the BEST and Cleanest location ! There are a TON of toppings there and the staff is great !	
0	Awful service . Despite the restaurant being half empty we were put on a wait because our party of 5 was too big to sit . They continued to seat 3 parties of 2 , before I went to ask how long the wait would be . I was told awhile . Servers had time to sit and talk but couldn 't possibly be bothered to help us . We left and enjoyed the Kona Grill for lunch .	
1	Small and quaint . Loved this place . I had the most delicious Espresso Macchiato and Heath Bar Fudge . This place is owner operated and he was so warm and welcoming . Would definitely recommend the coffee here . Was such a nice surprise to be welcomed by Todd ( owner ) . He 's worked over 2000 days in a row . Interesting story . Cash only but have an ATM inside .	
1	After bending over for Habs concessions , this is a good place to get a beer . Try the Rickards Cage Box ( or something Frenchie like that ) ... $ 10 for a HUGE 32oz jug . The meals are good for a bar grill , and staff is nice ... but why must it be a SWELTERING JUNGLE every time I go there ? Turn the temp down !	
1	Off the strip little lounge atmosphere is a big relief from chain and corporate hell in Las Vegas . It has a local feel that was a treasure in sin city . Have cocktails , have snacks , come on a night where they have a DJ , and feel a little more human off the strip .	
1	Best Pool party in Vegas ! ! Shout out to my girl Bex , who hook it up with a dope Cabana for a great deal ! Thanks for everything Bex . . you alway look out for a brotha ! Holla at my girl Bex and she will give you great deals on the hottest spot in Vegas .	
0	Mu Shu was closed so we gave this place a try for takeout . Sundays and Asian food , I know . I 'm Asian . Currently suffering worst food poisoning in this decade , the kind that tears your back up from violent heaving . Don 't get chicken .	
1	I love this place . I used to live in Squirrel Hill . I first started going there as a bar patron , then quickly realized how great the food is . Their buffalo chicken dip is awesome ! Its pretty great food for a reasonable price . The bartenders are great too !	
0	This place is horrible ! ! Sink backed up and black mold on the shower curtain ! I called and they fixed the sink but left the mold so I could feel like home in the ghetto ! Be warned ... Stay at your own risk !	
1	it took me awhile to actually find this place . but it was well worth the wasted gas . the burritos , tacos , beans , rice are all good . the food is top notch . if you go during lunch on a work week be prepared to wait in line to order and fight for an available table . the food is worth the fight .	
1	I can honestly say that this is the best pizza joint i 've been to in Las Vegas , better than Sammy 's any day . I only wish they had the bbq chicken pizza like Sammy 's has . I am at Grimaldis once or twice a month . If you haven 't been , GO !	
1	Take your own little trip around the world at this Plaza Midwood store . Pura Vida is such a great , unique shop / coffee bar / art and music venue . I can 't afford much of what they have there , so I 've bought cheaper things there like postcard - sized prints of paintings and candle holders . Definitely check out the art shows and musicians who perform in the back lounge .	
1	Great lunch , microbrews and service . Sheila was great ! The first time I went in it was just for drinks on a Tuesday night and the service was dreadful . Today more than made up for it . I will certainly be back .	
1	I love this place . My friends and I try to have a ' girl 's night out ' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere . It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces . The service is spectacular . This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign	
1	I have been sending packages back home for several years from this store . The staff are always friendly and helpful , and help me to choose the most cost effective method . I was in there just today , and was helped by Alexis , who was cheerful , and got me on my way happily in no time ! Two thumbs up !	
0	They told me they had to use a specific oil for a Honda . After talking to three different Honda dealers I found out they were Full of it ! Don 't waste time with people who run a business and don 't know what they are talking about .	
1	This one of the better PTs that I ' ve . Been to . They all have good service but this one isn 't as dumpy as the one on Durango . Friendly older crowd . Seems like date night . Crowded but not smoky for a bar that allows smoking . Will be back .	
0	I had heard raves about this restaurant so brought 3 guests for dinner . Food was just ok ( the 22 oz rib eye steak was 50 % fat and bones and was undercooked ; scallops just ok ; frites and vegies barely warm ) . Our waitress was very good which compensated a bit for the food .	
0	We wanted a quick lunch , and decided to stop here . Good lord , it was expensive and crappy . The reheated slice of pizza was almost $ 8 , and the plain hotdogs were $ 7 . Belch . And the tables were so close together , it was impossible to move . Just go somewhere else .	
1	I have been to many fine restaurants in my life . This is one of the best . The service and food was outstanding . It was our 11th & 12th anniversary- we got married American & Cambodian on successive days , so it was our 6th year . Couldn 't have been better .	
0	Worst place ever to watch a game . Audio up audio down audio up audio down the entire game . Who ever complains the loudest gets their way with game sound . Until the next person complains . Food average .	
1	Where else can you get a drink and play Mortal Kombat ? This place is awesome and totally what downtown and East Fremont is about . As a local , I am officially a fan and will come here often .	
0	Good food , as far as I can tell since in 45 minutes we have only gotten our appetizer . So far , the only reason to come is to get $ 35 in free drinks . Stay away !	
1	I can 't say enough good things about Riccio ' s . I love it ! ! ! I have been going there since I was a kid and nothing changes so delicious and never disappoints ! Hidden gem !	
1	It 's near by , it 's fast , and it 's easy . It 's never exceptional but it 's never bad . They mess up my order sometimes but I 've never cared enough to take it back . It 's pretty overall okay . Nothing phenominal but always hits the spot and I know what to expect . Service is fast and friendly . I grab food here once every few weeks and am always satisfied .	
0	I was disappointed when they gave me the sale price for my return on a known defective item that they put on sale since it was defective ( Wallflower Night Light ) . In these cases when it is known to be defective , they should exchange at full price .	
1	This I one of the best and most beautiful hotels and casinos here in Vegas . The architecture and the style is amazing . The Bellagio better look out ! The Aria 's fountains do rival the water shows at the Bellagio ! Absolutely stunning and a well thought out layout make the Aria a true gem !	
1	I 've really enjoyed every show I 've seen here . There isn 't a bad ' seat ' in the house . With the overall intimate size of the amphitheater , even lawn seats have a great view . My wife and I went an hour early for the latest visit and had a great time at the surrounding bars and restaurants . Will definitely come back to see more shows here .	
1	oh how i love the bellagio . i highly recommend staying in a baller room or suite . i think everything about this place is fabulous , the pool cafe , the fountains , the cheesy music channel in your room that plays the fountain tunes , and that chocolate business at jean - phillippe . i also won gambling , that was hot .	
1	I 've never heard Thievery Corporation played at any other venue in Vegas . There is a cocktail made with Lienenkugel beer which pleasantly surprised me . I appreciate the vibe here very much , and it 's definitely on my list of places to go in Fremont East . Though the hidden - in-plain - sight door messed me up the first time I went .	
1	It 's pretty good ... I really liked the brisket . I am still in search of the perfect BBQ place here in the Phoenix area . The service by the way was killer so I would recommend it . BTW check out the cool light fixtures when you are in there .	
0	Went to get a sandwich the one I wanted was already pre made . I don 't eat turkey only wanted ham they said make your own . So I did and instead of paying 11 - 14 dollars I paid 24 because I got extra chesse abd avocado but didn 't even get the extra cheese didn 't expect it to be that much . I will never go there again	
0	Had great quality when it opened but since the renovations a year or two ago the quality is below average . The selection is limited and most rolls taste identical . You can also expect to be yelling to be heard at your table due to the open layout and popularity with large groups . The review would be one star but I need to give credit for the service I received .	
1	I love thai food ! I 'll miss this place . I 've eaten here almost every day during my stay . Prices are great , favors are addictive and the atmosphere and service are friendly and casual . A must try !	
1	Absolutely the best dog grooming shop I 've ever been to . Sarah is an artist who must actually be able to speak to the dogs , she manages my demon with ease . Diane is easy to work with and they always make time for my last minute appointments . Best shop in town , I will continue to use them exclus9aa I have for over ten years .	
0	Best place in Charlotte for comics , hands down . Sadly , not the best place to go for a friendly staff . Condescending tones and mockery of things I asked for / was inquiring about are not a good way to get return business ! : ( I 'll buy online before I go in here again .	
1	Huge portions , great food , friendly and attentive staff . 1st time trying The Place and it did not disappoint . My 14 old son couldn 't even finish the 16oz steak and eggs . We will definitely be coming back .	
0	I was bringing my family to Cracker Barrow today a group of 6 but after hearing they fired a 73 year old Vet for handing out a Corn muffin I changed my mind ... ... I hope others feel the same way ... ...	
0	This was my second visit to this location . I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay ... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality . The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food . I 'm passing on this one .	
1	Stopped in and had their pad Thai along with some Thai tea . Everything was very good and very fresh . It 's a little on the lighter side , which was refreshing . Their coconut ice cream is amazing . 10 / 10 for Thai food in the area .	
0	It is the first time I gave 1 - rated review , while I normally gave 4 - 5 stars regardless of service quality . The worst service came from TWC . Took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done . All they did is to transfer the phone call to another representative after telling me I can 't do this , I can 't do that . Worst service ever !	
0	I originally booked my stay in Vegas here at Ballys . After check in I went to the room and I couldn 't believe the bad odor of cigarette smoke . I called the frond desk and they seemed put out that I wanted a different room . After waiting two hours I told them that I was canceling my stay and decided to go to a different hotel Casino .	
0	I 've been going to this Restaurant every Saturday for months ! It became almost like a family tradition ! The main reason my group went is because of the superb service we would get from JUSTIN ! We were at a loss for words to hear that he was no longer there ! Justin is such an asset and will truly be missed by many ! ! What a loss ! ! !	
0	Waited long line for hot chocolate ! ! Theyre sold out ! We got frozen hot chocolate instead even though its cold . Then we got a frozen corndog too ... Very disappointing . Service is okay not friendly understaffed .	
1	Lacking a clean or acceptable Chinese restaurant in Casa Grande , I discovered this jewel while showing homes in Anthem . Menu has many choices and restaurant is clean with attractive decor . The dishes I have chosen so far have been excellent with nice portions . Service is friendly and efficient . Well worth the drive from anywhere in Pinal County ! ! !	
1	We got there at midnight and ordered the Bronx Bomber and Garlic Knots . We decided to eat in and not only was the service vibrant and friendly but the good was well above average for 24hr pizza . Lots of workers , food was made fresh and served with a verity of dips . Will definitely be going back ! ! !	
0	The sushi was nasty and the fried ice cream tasted a little like onions . I love avocado , but it was smeared all over everything and dulled the flavor . The service was also extremely slow and I had to ask another server to retrieve my waiter . I was not impressed .	
0	The location and patio are great but I had poor service . We had to go find our own napkins and silverware . Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time not refilling our drinks . The food took an hour to get out to us and was poorly put together . Overall I was disappointed .	
0	Normal makeup application with an appointment is $ 50 and you get a free mascara . If you do not have an appointment there is a $ 50 product fee . I called to get an appointment on October 27 and because this is the weekend before Halloween they want to charge $ 70 and you have to purchase a gift card . I thought that was petty . I will not be booking at MAC .	
1	Almost great service ! Burgers are perfectly done and cooked your way . Kobe beef = awesomeness ! Bartenders always great in helping you pair it up with the right beer . Always crowded ... so get in early or sit at the bar . You can thank the hostess for not making this a 5 star ... . . this is a restaurant not a club . : )	
1	Love this place ! I 've been going here since they were tiny with just a handful of tables , before they expanded . A great mom n ' pop place that offers both great service and food ! Try the buffalo chicken pizza , delicious ! ! !	
0	Came there today around 1 o ' clock all the way from Middleton and it was closed . Hours on the web and on their store are 12 - 6 pm ! Called them and all I got was an answering machine : ( I hope this can be fixed	
1	Had weekday lunch there twice . Foods were basically similar though I ordered different dishes : once was the beef with sour cabbage with creamy sauce served with mashed potato , the other time was a sandwich with the same beef and sour cabbage . The flavor was good . Not much meal choices though .	
1	I LOVE this place ! ! They are amazing with customer service and they do great work too . Andy himself is hilarious and everyone there is really nice and attentive . If you really wanna be pampered definitely , this is the place to go .	
1	love it all ! but we always go back for the same things ! chicken pad se eww panang beef spicy # 7 hot hot hot ! chicken satay w/ peanut sauce all topped off with jasmine rice and a large thai ice tea mMmmMm YUM ! i think im going there for dinner yes !	
1	Friendly staff and great food ! This place is always packed ! ! I work as a nail tech next door and find myself here all the time for lunch or dinner ; ) Love it ... but it may be time to watch the waist line ! LOL !	
1	I keep going back to VooDoo for the great views . This time though my meal was also great . Our server remembered us from a previous visit and was quite helpful . The filet was excellent . The wine selection is very good . The one down side was the macaroni side . It was less than impressive . The mashed potato side made up for it though .	
1	Great park area ! It 's always clean and very well kept . We celebrated my son first birthday at one of the pavilions and all the kids had a blast . I was lucky that someone cancelled , apparently the pavilions book months in advance . The play area is completely covered , which is a necessity once it starts getting hot .	
0	flew in an out of international terminal or terminal 2 . Very sub par , they need to finish the new international terminal very soon cause this one does not have much to offer accept a shorter wait for a cab .	
0	Nothing ticks me off more than having to spend a lot of money on food that doesn 't taste good . The patio atmosphere was nice , and our waitress was attentive , but the prices were very high and the food was bland at best . Even the salsa was lacking . If you are looking for good Mexican food , don 't look here .	
0	I made a few trips to this mall during our week in the Phoenix area . The Nike Outlet was great , but otherwise , there weren 't that many quality outlet stores . Most ( or so it seemed to me ) of the stores in this mall are not outlets and there just weren 't the deals that I was expecting .	
1	What a great find ! A very reasonable price good for the entire family . The food was better than I expected . No wonder there was a long line . I got too full I couldn 't get to the famous oxtail soup that everyone is raving about . Well , next time . My favorite was their Kahlua Pork and chocolate cake ! !	
0	Way overpriced . Just go to Grand Lux for a cheaper , tastier , larger burger . Enough said . I would equate the burgers at I heart burgers to the quality of five guys or smashburger , except I heart burgers cost like 3 - 4X the amount .	
1	Always have a great experience here . Sometimes I have more than one massage to use so I 'll take advantage of a two hour and / or a facial . Well - trained staff with a clean environment . It 's so close to home and convenient .	
0	Although I 've never played this course , I give it one star because of their 48hr cancellation policy . If you are an out of town golfer do not book at this course , because if you can 't make your round for any reason you WILL be charged regardless . You 've been warned .	
1	Great curry and great service ! Their curry was delicious ; served with a variety of toppings ( I had veggies and chicken katsu . YUM ! ) and offered as mild , medium , or hot ! The cashier / waitress was really helpful and polite . The restaurant was very clean and our kids ate free because we dined in .	
0	This place is WAY overpriced and the food reminds me of eating in a cafeteria . The only bright spot to my meal was the coleslaw . The decor is very eclectic to put it nicely but nothing that makes it stand out . Service was ok but the server ignored me at first until I had to flag her down to ask to order a drink . Not somewhere if ever eat again .	
0	I have been trying to get coffee at this place multiple times BUT had no luck since they don 't open until late in the day 9am really ... . it also seems like a ice cream place than coffee shop . If you are real coffee drinkers wouldn 't come here . If you want fabulous pastries and coffee visit coffee bean	
0	I wish I had known this was closed as well . We camped out near here and thought would be a great photo opportunity- Alas , the gates were closed , the signs were hung- and the fence was BARBED . First time I had seriously considered trespassing- it looked like such a great spot for old timey photos , was tough to resist !	
1	Awesome doctor , very quick and efficient appt . she really is the best I have seen , I would definitely recommend her . You are In and out and your eyes are fixed lol , no fooling around and she is very sweet .	
1	Food was super good ! My new favorite spot . All the staff were so friendly and helped each other out . We always got checked on , and our grill was constantly being changed . Water was never empty and our server was so informative and sweet . Get the meat lover ! It 's definitely enough for 2 people and you get s ' mores ! ... S ' MORES ! ! ! !	
1	This is by far the best bbq in East - Central Illinois and it has one of the best beer selections around to go with it . Nearly everything is made from scratch and has that creative twist you only get when people really care about what they are doing .	
1	I tried their salted caramel ice cream at Devoured and wanted more ! When I got here I changed my mind and had the mint chocolate chip in a waffle cone . That was great as well . I 'm looking forward to the hot weather and more ice cream at SR !	
1	I went here for dinner and the food is good . My wife and I also had a bottle of Malbec that was tasty with all of the food . A pleasant experience all around . I enjoyed the lamb with mint jelly and the steak . It is really easy to eat here on a low carb diet and is very tasty .	
1	We have dined here twice and been pleased both times . The homemade gnocch is delicious as were the ravioli . I can 't recommend the escargot , however , they were ' t great . The waitstaff is friendly and efficient . You are able to dine inside or outdoors .	
1	AWESOME DIM SUM ! ! ! ! Good price and amazing selection . My only complaint is that it 's a mystery at times what you are getting as some of the server 's are not good with speaking english . Maybe some pics with explanations would help . I highly recommend eating here .	
0	Too expensive for not real cheesesteaks , they were on a sandwich roll not even on a Philly roll . And everything is all a cart . And everything is way too overpriced , $ 35 for two people .	
1	Very friendly service ! This DD takeover is certainly an improvement over the former crap that was located at this corner . I found the space to be welcoming and adequate for hanging out , having a latte while waiting to be seated at Pinky ' s .	
1	I 've been using Jen for my gel nails for a couple years now ! I was so excited when she and her husband opened their own salon , not only is it beautiful but very right and clean ! She is so sweet and is a perfectionist at what she does , oh and her polka dots are insanely perfect !	
0	I wish they would bring back their traditional restaurant style of service like they had in their old location . This has gone way down hill since moving to this location . The food they offer is decent but nothing like they used to serve . The menu has been scaled down tremendously . Please bring back the original Bombay Spice ! !	
0	this place has no business sense . just made a $ 1000 of purchases today and they wouldn 't let me leave the store with by cart full of items . instead , they made me make 5 trips to my car citing a cart theft problem . GARBAGE . Go to TJ Maxx Marshalls instead . better deals and they let you take you stuff to your car .	
0	Unless you check your order and like cold Hot Food then this place is for you . NOT ME ! Three chefs in the kitchen and no one knows what there are doing ! Not happy waiting almost 25 minutes for my cold order but almost another 12 minutes for a remake . I 'll go else where next time . Thanks but no thanks	
1	WOW the sushi here was AMAZING ! I am still dreaming about it . Next time I visit Montreal , I am definitely returning to Tri Express . Great food , great service , really nice decor . Such a small and cute restaurant , but I would recommend a reservation since it 's tiny and it was PACKED when I was there .	
0	I stayed at the SLS during opening weekend and everything was fantastic but this place is a FAIL ! Although the service is excellent and they are open late ( which is perfect for those late night noodle cravings ) the food is just not good , in fact its horrible . Go to the Griddle next door instead , you won 't be disappointed .	
1	This shop is such a great place to shop . ALL of the items are unique - most of it made by local artisans . Great gift ideas . Beautiful clothes & jewelry that are so affordable , I had to ask if the prices were right . Don 't miss the opportunity to experience this great little shop ! !	
1	Beautiful club , not so beautiful people . Great service - we bypassed the line and were let through immediately . The waterfall is massive and gorgeous . The music isn 't that great . Drinks are pricey , but that 's just Vegas . Minus one because the gogo dancers were sloppy . I would say 75 % men , 25 % women .	
1	Awesome staff . Sat at the counter and watched tons of great looking food go by . I went for the Lil ol Country Girl which is an egg , bacon , sausage , and biscuit and gravy . The kitchen claims proudly I come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage . And they delivered the best gravy I 've ever passed by my lips . We will definitely be back .	
1	Just recently moved to Las Vegas from Cali . This place was right by my house so I went in to office to get a quote . It was a Saturday and I was happy they were open ! ! ! I got to meet with the agent Jen and she was super friendly and down to earth . I highly recommend this office if you want a friendly staff and great deal ! : )	
0	I 'd rather go to a red mango or pink berry . They offer a variety of flavors and toppings . But yogurt here has a weird after taste most likely due to all the artificial flavorings and preservatives .	
1	What can I say ? I love their products . My favorite is the Hemp lotion for very dry hands . I went into buy it and the nice saleswoman showed me that it was cheaper to buy the gift box because it was on sale . She was right . I brought two .	
1	Very tasty food ! I 've grown up in Southern Ca and consider myself a pretty good judge of good Mexican food , but I did not expect to find it at a hotel in Vegas ! The taquitos and relleno are scrump . Recommend giving it a try !	
1	I 've been getting my nails done here for months definitely the best nail place one town . I also get my eyelashes done here too . Cheapest place I 've found and they last for weeks without even 1 eyelash falling out . I will never go anywhere else	
0	Chalk up another one for this place being awful . Poor service . I order the monthly special and get charged full price . Not friendly at all . I just live so damn close it 's hard to resist . I guess I will just have to quit Subway for a while .	
1	The food and the service are consistently good here . My only complaint is the cleanliness of the bathroom on the main floor . It smells like man pee . Otherwise , the food , the service , and the atmosphere are wonderful .	
1	I counted 20 beers on draft , all were very good . They keep a few bottles of wine around too , if that is your thing . Great place to visit , well lit and a great addition to the Arizona craft brew scene . Keep up the good work .	
1	Just finished dining here . Best meal I 've had in Vegas on this vacation . Beautiful view , friendly service and incredible food . They paced the four course meal well . If you don 't mind spending the little extra dough go for it , you won 't be disappointed .	
0	A big F . Made reservation and arrived on time . Lost reservation and had nerve to ask me who I talked to . Showed them the return call number my I - phone to No avail . If u make reservation , B sure to get name of the reservation taker and call back to verify !	
0	One word ... DISGUSTING . Got a free night In July 2013 through a friend with hook ups . Dirty carpets full of oil stains everywhere . I wore flip flops during most of my time there , not bare foot , and my feet were so dirty because of the oil everywhere ! ! UNACCEPTABLE ! ! Smells SO BAD Everything is outdated . 2 electrical outlets did not work in our room . NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN .	
1	I tried number 9 - grass jelly and pandan jelly with coconut milk . It was good at first but got too sweet after awhile . I 'll try something else the next time I 'm here . This place is new and clean .	
1	Great Service Great food . try the hot lasagna , 911 if you like spicy Happy Hour is at it 's best 10pm - 2am . . they also have an earlier happy hour at an earlier time . been here 3 - 4 times	
0	20 oz beers OK , but $ 8 for that beer , hrm . Loud thumping music makes it difficult to have a conversation - on the phone or otherwise . If you 've got to wait for a plane , meh , it 's alright , but wouldn 't be my first choice in the future .	
1	I 've always been impressed with the service at this location . The wait staff is always super friendly and always quick when you need something . The food is amazing every time . The endless shrimp and lobster fest deals get me coming back every year when I see the commercials on TV .	
0	Travelocity = Frustration and Grey Hair ! Spent almost 5 hours speaking with 5 different customer service reps in INDIA , trying to cancel my reservation . They answer your questions from the book and not by the situation .	
1	A friend of mine , she is French but lives here in Scottsdale , took me to this genuine French restaurant . I had the Quiche du jour and it was heavenly good ! So happy to have found this place since I really have missed good food . I will be coming back a lot !	
1	Great location , great store ! The only reason I took off a star was cause it took me the longest time to find someone who could help me . But once I did they were great ! Very nice and helpful .	
0	Service is slow , drinks are nothing to write home about . I wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short . I always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides Starbucks , but it seems this place is just missing the mark .	
1	A little undecided here as standard pricing is on the high side but they sometimes offer groupons and have some decent happy - hours . . Mainly nice that they have a swanky bar adjacent ( The Living Room ) to change up the scene when the time comes .	
0	If you are looking for authentic Mexican food DO NOT EAT HERE . This was by far some of the worst food I have ever tasted . My enchiladas had two slices of American Cheese on them and my margarita was so sweet and filled with syrup I chose to not drink it . Absolutely not worth the money .	
0	We drive 25 minutes every time we want Qdoba . The last couple times our food has been great , but the service sucks . Employees are rude . They don 't great you with the typical banter . It feels a lot like we are inconveniencing them . Not sure it 's worth the drive anymore ...	
0	The price of the rental was more than our airline ticket . This location is where all of the rental cars are held . It was hard to find and I will not rent from them again . At least not in Vegas .	
0	Came in around 6pm on a Sunday , not too busy , yet still took forever to get our order in . Water tasted funny , so we ordered 2 three dollar drinks . Ordered the BBQ burger , not too bad , but nothing special .	
1	Best ramen house in Vegas ! The food and service are great . The ramen miso broth is my favorite add some sweet corn and butter , life is good ! This place is small , so plan your visit accordingly because when they are busy prepare to wait for a seat . It can also get a little warm inside .	
1	I stayed at the Aladdin and was stoked to kind an ABC Store in it . It was like being in Hawaii . I know it 's just a convenience store , but there is something about ABC that I just love . It takes me back , you know ?	
0	Fourth times a charm ? -- in that THIS is the 4th time I 'm posting a review of Giligin 's on Yelp . The first three were inexplicably targeted , flagged by the community , and removed by Interpol . I will attempt to stay within the boundaries of the ambiguous review rules , but not without saying that this place sucks the ass end of a donkey .	
0	Pros : There are lots of options , and the portion sizes are big . The ingredients are fresh , and the staff is courteous . Cons : The food is only OK . Every meat dish we ordered came out a little overcooked and tough , and there was way too much cilantro in almost everything . And while the prices aren 't exorbitant , it 's not exactly a great value either .	
1	Enrico is a great place for a quality cut . He is busy , and the phone does ring , but in all the many times I 've been there he books the guy , hangs up and moves on . Seriously , it 's a good hair cut , he listens to what you want , and delivers for a fair price .	
1	It was actually better than I expected , great Mac&chesse , yams , and fried chicken ! ! ! I only wish the hot bar was more like a buffet , other then that great soul food ! ! !	
0	Disappointing at best- had fresh spring rolls , came wrapped in crepe not rice paper as advertised on menu- had pad Thai- kinda a big glob of noodles with a a few slices of carrot and green onion and no peanut garnish- nota keeper ! !	
0	I was sorely disappointed with the food here because I used to frequent Spicy Pickle all the time when there was a location on St . Rose and Eastern . I always get the Lobster Bisque and the Bandito Panini , which I got again on this day for lunch . The soup was lukewarm and my sandwich was flavorless . Needless to say , there are way too many other sandwich places for me to return . : (	
1	A very nice traditional French bakerie & deli . They have fresh baguette , rolls , desserts , cold case with cheeses , pates , and duck confit . We got a very nice cheese and spinach quiche . They boxed it up with string . Great customer service and wonderful quality .	
0	We 've been here 2 - 3 times and only repeated hoping the previous bad experience was a fluke . No more . Poor service , cold food that should have been hot , slightly wrong orders , and the list could go on . The owner typically is just sitting at the bar looking dejected and the live music they have is subpar and loud . No more tries .	
1	I love this place it 's just down the road from our house and it 's a great place to hang out . The food is ok but I love kicking back and enjoying the tropical setting . they have been great to the little league kids and the adults have fun . It 's a great neighborhood bar that you alwyas feel safe in with or without the kids .	
1	I came here on a Sunday afternoon . My waiter was on point and did a great job . The food was good , but I can 't say I really enjoy the decor . Overall I enjoyed my lunch and I would come back .	
1	the store reminded me of the hunting / sports stores they had in upstate new york , but much bigger . everyone is super nice and are willing to show or help you find anything . the have lots of firearms and wide selection of ammunition . most of their ammo is expensive . even the standard stuff you can find at walmart . i always buy the lemon drops when i come here .	
0	Was not a fan . For the prices I wanted to be wowed but it was only eh . Servers tried too hard ( we ended up with 3 servers some how ) . Sorry but won 't be back	
1	Great cocktails and fun atmosphere . The crinkled copper behind the bar is beautiful and different . The service is great , especially for the price point . Food is inventive and delicious . Menu is updated periodically , usually to the better .	
1	I have used Lauren several over the past couple of years . She is a true professional and a genuine pleasure to work with . She listens to what you want and does a beautiful job to accommodate your needs . I highly recommend her , as she is a personal favorite MUA of mine !	
1	Great atmosphere , food and staff ! ! ! The restaurant is at what used to be an old home and has a lovely outdoor seating area with cafe lights and landscape . Perfect place to cozy up with a cup of joe and great food . There are also some rescue birds that you can walk around and see after your meal . Highly recommend ! ! !	
0	The waiters are pretty hot . . well not all of them but many . . the food is so so . . service , if I had bigger boobs I think the service would have been better . . would not return . . I wake up to a hot man every morning so I have no worries about checking the waiters out again .	
0	By Vegas standards , it 's CHEAP pricewise but keep in mind , you do get what you pay for . . and honestly , i think HOMETOWN BUFFET tastes better then circus circus . avoid like the plague !	
1	Japanese food at its finest wanted to do the eat all you can sushi , but wanted to try this place this the reviews were glad to say that Naked Fish did not disappoint . Will be trying the other dishes when we come back here .	
0	Not very impressive at all . I went there for the famous hot wings challenge and completed it in 20 minutes . They did not out my name on their Wall of Flames for some reason : ( Seriously though , their food is very mediocre and the beer is just OK . The service was alright and there is just nothing that really stands out comparing to other pubs .	
1	One of the few places in Vegas I can go to and enjoy Tex - Mex . Having grown up in Fort Worth , I prefer Tex - Mex to Cali - Mex , and OTB has a great menu that reminds me of home . I especially enjoy their empanadas , their salsa , and the flautas , but just about everything on the menu is great .	
0	pretty mediocre place . when you go to a steak place shouldn 't the steak be even close to how you ordered it . not to mention how my wife felt after about two hours . the service was fair to good .	
0	Twice I 've caught Espresso Royale staff overcharging me for my drinks . Mind this if you are ordering a tea latte , because somehow they charge you for a coffee latte instead , which is way more expensive . In addition , I caught food poisoning from their mango smoothie .	
0	Sub Par at best , Carne Asada plate two bland pieces of steak , tough and you have to chop it up yourself , the rice is bleh . I live down the street and I thought I would give this place a second chance due to construction on McDowell Rd , I 'll continue going to LosBetos from now on . Even the photos on their drive thru menu look bland .	
1	First time coming here . Just got the standard $ 5 wash ( it 's $ 3 Monday - Friday ) . Pretty decent job for a quick automated wash . Didn 't use the vacuums this time but will in the future ! !	
1	Classic delicious wings . Beer specials for happy hour . Friendly bartenders / waiters that sing to you and their coworkers , and FOOTBALL / any other sport you could imagine on their numerous big screens around the bar . I hope you have a ride home after your awesome sports outing , because you should stay a while !	
0	This is the slowest pharmacy ever . They go from one phone call to another completely ignoring the customers who are waiting in person . They quote wrong wait times which are often doubled . I 'm not sure what makes them so much slower than other pharmacies .	
0	Hertz is horrible at this location . As a frequent traveler car return was a joke . 20 people waiting no one checking in cars . After waiting 15 minutes I got disgusted and left . They charge more and there is no excuse for wasting 20 minutes of my time when on a flight schedule . So much for hertz trying harder	
1	I love this place ! Their sundaes are AMAZING . The Frozen Hot Chocolate is just a bit over rated for my taste ( if you like chocolate milk then go for it ) . The You get what you pay for at this place and the service is awesome . If you 're visiting Vegas or even just a local , this place is a must .	
1	Amazing ! ! ! ! Robert returned calls quickly and managed our expectations on his arrival time ! Our furniture and rug looks great ! ! ! He took extreme care and time with each piece ! We also had our vents done ! We are extremely happy with the results and his professionalism ! Highly recommend Robert ! ! !	
1	I love this place ! I don 't know if its their style of ordering , the toasty delicious bread , variety of sides & drinks , location of being in Planet Hollywood , service , or just the sandwiches . . But this place is inviting & worth it . Their soups are even good . & they even sell beer !	
0	I don 't understand what all the hoopla is about . The food was lousy . The ribs tasted like the cow had mad cow disease . The sauce was weak . Overall , the food is overpriced . I 've gone to this place twice and all I can say is I loved the beer !	
0	Rooms need to be updated but location is very nice . However , DO NOT answer the call for completing the survey of your stay for 20 percent off your bill . SCAM ! ! Our bank informed us of fraudulent charges of 2700 . 00 .	
1	This is a really good Starbucks location . Unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional , it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs , plenty of plugs for web surfers , and a decently - sized outdoor seating area . The staff is really friendly and efficient as well . There is also a drive - through .	
1	LOD 10 Been here a couple times after the pool . Great spot to order n eat Tapas . Everything we ordered was good - the stand out was a chicken dish that we had to double up on .	
0	The entire vibe of this place just felt off . The dancers seemed unhappy to even be there . The private dances seemed more like an opportunity to milk as much money as possible from the clientele . Oh , and there 's a cover every night for some unknown reason .	
1	Of course , delicious . This one is a lot bigger than the one I normally go to , but its service never wanes . I 'm still on the fence about the fries in general at In - N-Out . They always seem raw ? Sometimes I like to be a superglutton and get cheese fries . Definitely something to try out .	
1	I LIKE Nine Fine Irishmen ! I discovered it a few years back and always make it a point to visit whenever I 'm in Vegas . It has a classic , Irish pub atmosphere which I absolutely love . ( I 'm a pub girl ) . The food is good and of course , they have Guinness ! ! ! ( And very cool pint glasses )	
1	Long overdue review . KIMCHI FRIED RICE IS A MUST ! ! ! ! ANYTHING with the kimchi is good . We ordered a couple of other dishes like the kimchi burrito , nachos , fish tacos , sandwiches . They 're just OK . The place is small , service is quick with a smile . Since all the food is made to order , prepare to wait a bit .	
0	I will never us this company again and will go out of my way to sway anyone I talk to , also to never use them . They have never heard of normal wear and tear of the property if your place doesn 't look exactly the way they expect it to be you will lose most of your deposit , and it not a little one .	
1	Probably this is the best Korean restaurant around Phoenix area . Personally i think it is better than Kodori . At least the waiter / waitress are bit nicer : ) . The qualify of the food is good but the price is a bit high .	
0	The service at this Popo 's is not that great ! The original Popo 's we never had to ask for anything . At this Popo 's we had to ask to be served , and this site feels like a chain .	
1	This establishment is the sister restaurant to the Sushi Mon 's in town . It is really fabulous . Not only is it delicious , it is also close to work . Also , there is a very cool vibe flowing through here . I think it 's me ... It is normally very busy . Adjust accordingly . Enjoy !	
1	Had a fun night here . I haven 't been to a hooka bar in 10 years ! We went for drinks and hooka . Staff was friendly , decor is nice . They are a bit pricey but I guess that can be expected in old town !	
0	I got the pad kee mao and my noodles were a little hard and bland . My friend got pad thai style noodles with crab on top , and his noodles were delicious . Service was friendly albeit slow considering we were the only party there ...	
1	I actually had a really fun time ! We rode it at night and the view with all the Vegas lights was awesome . I didn 't expect to like it , so maybe that 's why I liked it so much . I even bought the photo -- this is the first time I have done that for any ride . The obvious downfalls are price and the length of the ride is too short .	
0	Never again . Long strands of hair in my roll . Sushi is usually made with bare hands ... If something as long and obvious as hair makes it in , what else is getting in the rolls ? Nope . Not going back .	
1	When i moved here from California I had a really hard time finding an amazing hairstylist . When I had Alisha T . Do my hair she gave me exactly what I wanted . The cut is amazing and the color is beautiful .	
0	Apparantly after 10 years I 've been removed from the delivery zone and told that they have never delivered to me because they have no delivery history . Hmmmm ... . I 've got 10 years of order history from this store but they have never delivered to me . Never , Never , Never go to this store if you can help it . HORRIBLE customer service ! !	
1	This place totally surprised me . The staff was warm and friendly and the food was both unique and very fresh . The gnocchi was excellent . They even had a kids menu although they seem to cater more toward adults .	
1	The sandwich was a bit thin but still good . My steak and meatball pho was good but a bit fragrant . Like it had to much star anise . Over all the food was good and so was our experience there .	
1	Very nice people who did an amazing job on two of our computers . One was the transfer of files from an old computer to a newly purchased one . The other computer was a laptop that was running very slow . The laptop is now running great , it 's like it is a new computer . I am already recommending these guys to friends . They do an amazing job !	
1	The best ! I haven 't been there in years and the last time we went it was a 3 . 5 hour wait but so worth it ! Great for a date if you want to get to know someone waiting in line so long . My advice is to arrive at 330pm so that way you can be one of the first in line and eat with the first seating at 5pm .	
1	Great unexpected find . Came to SLS to try another restaurant but it was closed . Walked into Cleo on a gamble . Sat at the bar . Great bartending staff . Try the Old Hollywood cocktail if you like bourbon . Each of the small plates were great . You can easily go into a food coma here . The Shawarma was exceptional . I 'll be back . Check it out !	
0	I hate this place so much . The company I work for puts us here because it 's cheap . Everything about it I can 't stand . The lay out of this place sucks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It 's like frickin shoots and ladders ! And the whole place smells like crap . My whole experience here wasn 't good .	
0	Great name . Average food . Actually , come to think of it the Tortilla soup was quite good . The cheese enchiladas ... not so much . Service was pretty good . And there is a nice patio . Music was awful .	
1	Yummy sushi ! We finally found a place to eat sushi in las Vegas - The Island Sushi and Grill . It 's sooo good and it 's all you can eat . The ahi , tako and crab poke are addicting ! The hamachi kama is to die for ! All sushi are made to order and the desserts are good . The malassada sundae is very delish , reminds me of Hawaii ... .	
0	Terrible hair cut , the person cutting my hair ( attempting ) had to call someone over twice to fix her mistakes , I didn 't think a one on the sides and a fohawk fad was too much to ask for , well ended up going home and shaving my head ... . Stay away from this place	
1	The best place to the country to have you Ferrari services . All the service guys are awesome . They are honest and they do a good job . I bring my car here from California for service . I 'm not the only guy that does that . There is a reason .	
1	The subs are always awesome here . . today I got the hook and ladder light which is a good option if you want a lower calorie sub . On the other hand you can get the Italian sub which is full of salami and ham . Also they have a hot sauce bar that you can try a ton of different sauces which is kind of fun .	
1	This place puts Charlotte foodie dining to shame . Halibut cheeks , rocky mountain oysters , bone marrow , and anything else a food lover would want . Not to even mention the stellar and inventive bar menu . Don 't leave without trying a gin and tonic on tap !	
1	My recent stay at South Mountain was Fantastic ! ! ! Very nice and friendly staff , Very clean lobby , very clean room , very clean bathroom , very clean restaurant and a very nice and delicious breakfast . So overall FPts South Mountain is a joy to stay at and unwind .	
1	Great , clean professional shop . Alex did my tattoo . He is nice , personable and professional . Very happy with my tattoo . Looking at his work his black and gray tattoos are amazing and portrait work is great . Recommended if in Vegas !	
1	Ask for Josh Hernandez . I have been going to Josh with my families cars for over 5 years . It 's hard to find someone who you can trust as a mechanic and when I found Josh I 've stuck with him . I know I can count on him to take care of me , my wife or our 19 year old daughter with honest , friendly service .	
1	I 've been trying to find a good stylist for a while and I decided to try Megan out at Globe . The salon is nice and Megan was awesome . She took the time to understand exactly what I wanted and offered suggestions along the way . Megan was friendly and talkative and explained what she was doing and why along the way . I 've already made my follow up appt .	
1	I had a friend pick up some # 1 combo sandwiches and it was crispy delicious and just enough sauce . Bread was fresh and really crisp . They called in the order and sandwiches were good to go . I think it is yummier than some of the lees in la .	
0	Here 's a thought , don 't post on the door to your restaraunt Up scale Mexican Food unless you can prove it . This was not upscale , it was barely pass - able as decent . Didn 't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong . Will not return .	
0	Meh . Met some friends to grab a bite . Sweet potato fries were OK but soggy . Grilled cheese bites were recommended , but looked like something you 'd do at home , just chopped into smaller pieces . Wings were ... wings . Good location if you want to meet at a bar in Caesars , but food leaves something to be desired ...	
1	I 've been here twice now and have been very pleased both times ! They do an excellent job and are very efficient . The only reason I didn 't give five stars was because when they massage your legs and feet for a pedicure it is for a very short amount of time . Other than that I highly recommend Pro Nails by Julie !	
0	The brow lady , Nicky has gone to the AZ state board many times for lashes and waxing brows without a license ! This is not how the original owner ( Jennifer ) would have wanted it . This place should be shut down !	
1	this place is so wonderful ! warm bread always , good food , service is amazing . I always have to come here first when I get to Vegas . Wish they had one in the Bay Area . I se people compare it to Cheescake Factory but this is way better but yet somewhat similar . Located in The Venetian Hotel .	
0	I went once because I live real close , and wanted mexican food . Unfortunately , I will not be going back because it was not good . I got a burrito and it was doused in oil , it was just terrible . I did not even finish it , because it was causing an upset stomach . Maybe I just chose the wrong dish , but that dish caused me to not wanna go back .	
0	Food was good . 2nd guessed my self while eating and watching the guy at the counter go to change the trash bag , and take the trash out and go immediately back to the counter to take orders and pack food without washing his hands in between . Several times ...	
0	The ambiance , location , and live music were fantastic . I even enjoyed the Downtown Teatini which was delicious ! The menu , however , was lacking in vegan and / or vegetarian options . I had the apple salad which was disappointing . It was simply a house salad with sliced apples on the side . We waited so long to get it , I thought it would be worth the wait . Not the case .	
0	$ 40 cover for guys , $ 20 for girls . Drinks are normal club prices . This club reminds me of a 2 story Bank ( at the Bellagio ) . No air ventilation , filled with smoke and jackass bartenders makes me never want to go here again unless either TIESTO is spinning , or I get in for free . I 'll stick with XS or try Vanity	
0	This is a terrible bar ! Terrible ! They drove out all of the good staff due to the owners insane rants . They have a strange smell , their pints aren ' t , they are in undersized glasses to look like pints . They are over priced , and the food quality has seriously suffered in the last year . Save the trouble and go next door to san tan brewery !	
0	Read all of the positive reviews so we went to Le Peep this past Mother 's Day . Very disappointed ! The food is very average . We ordered the sausage skillet , omelet and pancakes . All were over cooked . The decor is very dated and desperately needs an update . Will not be returning .	
1	I went to a Bob Marley laser show as a ' favor ' for my husband ... the lasers were really cool . I would not recommend them if you are prone to migraines , or have a neuro disorder , such as seizures . I think if the music was more my taste , it would have been awesome .	
1	A professional esthetician and one - woman show , Debbie customizes each treatment to suit your skin and your mood . She is savvy and experienced , staying abreast of the latest developments in the field . A monthly facial with Debbie is something I wouldn 't miss . She also carries a great selection of products , and I 'm always delighted with the results !	
1	After being a client at a studio ( c ) in sundial plaza and paying a ridiculous amount ( $ 500 ) for the standard cut and color I decided to try salon chella . So happy that I did . Not only was the price 1 / 4 of the cost at the other salon , the result was 10 times better ! Go see Kim .	
0	The food was fine , but not worth trying again . I got sesame chicken and it was pretty good , but the Hunan beef had very little meat and tasted nothing like normal Hunan . The dumplings were ok , but the sauce was strange and sweet and they forgot my egg roll . All in all it was not terrible , but it was at best ok .	
0	If hanging around a bunch a douchy frat boys is your style then get here early BC you wont want to miss out on all of the fun . The place is dingy and the food really stinks . As bars go this is the kind of spot that high schoolers would go to with their fake ids and would fit right in .	
1	I love this place . It 's unique . It 's not New York thin with little cheese and cut in wedges . Great sauce , great crust , great sausage , lots of cheese , cut in little squares . Awesome . Order with extra sauce . Good stuff . You can find cheaper pizza but not much better around here . Yum .	
1	Over the past couple of years , I have been in here a few times for gifts . A few things I like about Little Luxuries : free giftwrapping , nice selection of colorful stainless steel water bottles , excellent cards , and cute sunglasses for $ 10 .	
0	Service here sucks . I love the food still . But the service is so bad , I never want to come back . Honestly . Sorry Zinc , ya 'll need to get new servers or some shit . AWFUL service . AWFUL management .	
1	SO much fun ! I went here last weekend and had a total blast . The staff and crowd are beyond friendly . If you 're looking for cheap well made drinks , and a great environment check it out ! There is a cover , which doubled as a drink voucher so no big deal . The Drag show on Friday 's rocks ! ! Worth stopping by .	
1	I came here with a freebie gyro coupon , and I must say it was way bigger than expected , not dry and the yogurt sauce was tasty , but wish I had a little more , as I ate half and save half for the next day , with no sauce : ( . Yes the average cost for a gyro is $ 7 - 8 , which is about right ... And service was fast and friendly ...	
1	Very welcoming vibe , and great service . I love this casual joint . Today was my very first visit there . But I 'll certainly be back again . Especially for their out of this world roast beef sandwich and spinach salad .	
0	I was hungry and it was late . I did not feel like eating McDonalds or any of the other garbage on the strip . My friend told me that there is a Korean restaurant that 's open pretty late so I decided to try this place . I had the tofu soup which was not spicy and lacked flavor . I also had their dumplings which did not taste that good .	
1	I really like this place . The food is consistent and high quality , and the prices and service are excellent . They are often busy and the actual restaurant decor , etc . is nothing special , but you are there for the food , right ?	
0	Great service , beer selection , and cozy atmosphere . Avoid the pretzels and house brats . Maybe i got an old pretzel but quality control is badly needed there . Bratwurst was way too modern and did not taste good . Stick with traditional German food and i will come back .	
0	This place is soooo overrated . Food is not that great AT ALL . Decent , but terribly overpriced . Decor is beyond cheesy -- they 're really trying way too hard . And to list this place as Cuban is laughable .	
1	I love this place ! Been coming here since 2000 when I moved here from Hawaii . Whenever I need my comfort food I order the fried saimin . It 's the best ! But today I tried the hot wings and I 'm upset I haven 't ordered them before because they 're so ono ! A little sweet with some spiciness to it . And still crispy too . I highly recommend !	
1	I 've been back twice since my last review . On our last visit , we were there after midnight and the drinks definitely aren 't as good at full price . Happy Hour is the way to go .	
0	Beware , I was shocked to find out they charge a delivery fee for each item . I ordered 3 sandwiches and was charged $ 4 . 09 delivery . That 's $ 1 . 36 ea . Ridiculous , almost the cost of a sandwich .	
0	Hadn 't been here in a while but now I know why , what a faded glory . The place is tired and dated . The food while quality has also faded . Spring rolls under cooked , sesame ahi was tasteless and how do you run out of spicy mustard .	
0	Horrible staff ! ! ! ! Bartender constantly asking me if I 'm playing ( for comp drinks ) . my husband being accused of picking up someone else 's money by the pitboss . Worst casino experience in Vegas ! ! ! !	
1	The skinny ... the street tacos are AMAZING and the bartenders are very friendly and attentive . Great happy hour for a quick stop in the afternoon ! Love Love Love the atmosphere . Open air . Not your usual Mexican restaurant . Tequila with a twist ! We enjoy the experience and will always come back .	
0	My instinct always told me that I should skip this place . Should have listened . It was just gross ; literally and figuratively . I was afraid to see what I was stepping on out on the dance floor . Music was good , drinks were surprisingly decent . But oh , the other club patrons ... I appreciate a little adult fun time dancing as much as the next gal , but it was just sleazy .	
1	We were in from San Diego and all 6 of us loved our food . The portion sizes were huge , we could have shared . The service was excellent . And you can 't beat 99 cent margarita ' s ! ! When we 're in Phoenix again we 'll definitely go here .	
1	Absolutely delicious from start to end . Drunken noodles are the bomb . Garlic noodles too . In fact , everything was terrific . The fried banana and coconut ice cream were the perfect end to a great meal .	
0	Its a scam ! ! They rise ur insurance rates without telling u claiming they can get a deal but all goes in there pocket the whole time ur paying ... watch out az for all auto glass is the same ... a lil crack cost u a thousand in fees ! ! Beware ! !	
1	Pretty good , a bit dirty and it definitely needs a new coat of paint on the front , but the food tasted fresh and the staff was very friendly . I 'll go back when I 'm craving Vietnamese in this area .	
0	I 've eaten a lot of Lobster Rolls , but I have to say this is The Absolute Worse One Ever and they are rude to top it off . It was dry dry dry dry omg $ 26 sandwich yuck	
0	I was very disappointed and offended by our server on my visit to hash house . He not only seemed to know absolutely nothing about the menu , he served me a meal with garlic in it after I told him I was allergic ! ! He clearly had no regard for his job or for other people ! ! Unfortunately due to this experience I will not be going back	
1	Very very good , expensive , but worth it . We ordered the small tasting menu . Perfect if you want a little taste of a bunch of different stuff . Waiter wasn 't that friendly , but he did a very good job as far as service is concerned .	
1	I went to this location after waiting for a hour and a half at an Advanced Urgent Care in Mesa and leaving . I went to this urgent care and was seen with in 10 minutes . The PA seemed very competent and all went well .	
1	Fantastic steakhouse . It has everything Flemings has with the same quality but within a five minute drive of my doorstep and at least 15 - 20 % less expensive . We usually eat here on holidays ( Christmas Eve , Easter and birthdays ) when visitors come to town and the occasional happy hour which puts us there 12 - 15 times a year .	
1	Onion soup had delicious gruyere cheese . Steak was filling and the blue cheese dressing was great ! The servers were fast and very professional . A great choice for a classic restaurant . If it 's busy , don 't expect to see the bellagio fountains from the outside patio ... .	
1	The crab is delicious . I had bought some gift certificates from another chain that was among a conglomerate of restaurants and Red Lobster was one of the valid restaurants so I used the certificates here . I got a crab combination meal and an additional 1 lb of crab legs . Yum . Crab Crab Crab !	
1	Went to the Belk Bowl here . I couldn 't believe how nice the stadium is inside . When Atlanta builds a new stadium , they need to take note . I was impressed by the food selection & quality . The bathrooms stayed clean & the attendants were all very nice & smiling . Kudos to the designers & managers of this facility . We had a nice visit to Charlotte & a W in the BoA Stadium .	
1	Hope they keep this store if BN has any plans of closing more stores . We used to come here to study ; then it was to peruse after we started our professional careers . Now , we come here as a family to pick out books for our toddler . Good times !	
1	I am not a big sushi fan but my boyfriend absolutely loves this place . I love that you can get all you can eat at a reasonable price and it includes appetizers and desserts . The quality seems good and service is fast ... .	
0	Honestly wasn 't the best ramen I 've tried in Vegas . The gyozas ( pot stickers ) weren 't as crispy and the broth was a little too oily for me . This is coming from a native Japanese girl so , yeah .	
1	finally checked this place out tonight ( a monday ) and I have to say , I was impressed . we were seated immediately and our waiter was super attentive . I might wait to go back until it cools down a little as they don 't have a / c , but you really can 't beat $ 16 for a great pizza and a pitcher ... not to mention interesting atmosphere and good music playing .	
0	I love Paradise Bakery and eat there often , it has been hard having some locations close and change names . My friend and I met at Paradise Bakery and were shocked at how rude an employee Jenna was to the other staff working . When you are rude to other people it reflects bad on you . Jenna , you need to take a BE NICE class .	
0	Went there with my husband food was ok , ordered the shrimp with lobster gravy this place added green peppers to the meal , Never had pepper in my shrimp n lobster gravy before and this ruined the taste . Will not return there again .	
1	Perfect breakfast , brunch , or lunch . I had the monte cristo which was just the right amount of sweet and a great blend of flavors . My husband had the chicken and the egg and it too was delicious . Both the chips and cucumber salad are solid sides . We will be back . Highly recommend .	
1	My favorite breakfast place ! I 'm vegan and it 's hard to find a place I can eat with my boyfriend who doesn 't eat tofu or seitan . We both love this place . Their pies are heavenly and everything is so delicous . You gotta try the the jack fruit barbacoa . All the staff are friendly and very down to earth . Very unique home style diner experience : )	
0	Nothing good to say . One of the drivers almost hit my car on street . When we stop , almost side by side , he opened his mini van door and he started saying things to me . What kind of philosophy have this company ? ? ? Probably rude and unprofessional people .	
0	Food is average at best . But last two times the service was terrible . They need to retrain their servers in customer service . The only reason for the 2 stars is that there is no denying that their cheesecake is excellent .	
1	I went to this restaurant yesterday looking for a reasonably priced sushi restaurant and I found one ! I had the spider rolls and the crunchy rolls , both were great and both were under $ 10 . Service is quick , and don 't let the outside intimidate you ! It 's a hole - in-the - wall and is family owned so if you support small business I recommend you check this place out .	
1	Been eating here off and on when I am on leave and visiting the family ! Their pizza and pasta is great ! The service and staff are great also ! ! Anything you order off the menu you cannot go wrong !	
1	I 'd never eaten sushi before , and this conveyer belt style was a great way to get introduced . I got to see everything available and ask questions about everything in real time rather than be force to decide from a menu . My more experianced sushi friends raved about it to .	
0	Never order Mexican with a slick facade . Anyplace in a strip mall with Grandma back in the kitchen usually yields the gold . This place , all hipster glitter and low rider bikes , needs to spend less time with the chrome and more time with the food . I was underwhelmed by everything on the menu , even the guava Margarita . Will not be going back .	
1	Beautiful decor . One of my favorite salads . Avacadoe on the bottom , stocked with Greens , with a crunchy top . For an Entree i love the Lasagna and the Osu Buco ( forgive my spelling ) . Service is great . I Definately recommend .	
1	This is a lovely little antique store tucked away in a small strip mall right beside Lollypop Vintage . It has quite a bit of higher end jewelry if you are looking for a really nice piece for a special occasion . The owner is knowledgeable , very courteous and will consider buying antique or pre - 1945 items , which I listed in one of the photos . Limited hours ... but definitely worth a look .	
1	New Mexican cuisine ... awesome food ... . and our waiter was right on the ball ... sat outside on patio which at night is terrific ... lighting ... . fire places ... ... . heaters to keep you warm ... causual and relaxing ... . . prices on menu very affordable for all that you get ... . as Meg says this place is bomb . com	
1	My brother , his girlfriend and I went here and were so impressed . The couple who run the center were knowledgeable , friendly and so helpful . They have a true passion for inspiring people to be climbers . As a novice , I found many routes I enjoyed and challenged me . I highly recommend this gym !	
0	i 've rented many cars in many location , but here is the first to add on additional insurance without my consent , or at least my understanding , making it a very expensive rental . Confusing at best , I notice that I 'm not the only one with this experience . There are better options in the same rental hall .	
0	Not impressed . Been there over 8 times the last 2 months . Cold , Burnt , Rock hard orange chicken . Rice all clumped together and tasted frozen . So not a fan of this Panda . There are other ones farther away that I would rather drive too and get better food . I love Panda - just not this location .	
1	Agree with the previous great reviews . Based on those reviews , I went by there and got a battery for my watch . Quick and easy and they are so incredibly nice and personable . You can join an email list for monthly emails of coupons or specials and to make this place even sweeter ... . it is right next to a walk up / drive through Starbucks . A win win if you ask me !	
0	Chopsticks in Matthews is 10times better , All we tasted was salt , salt , and more salt . The eggrolls was hard and where were the stuffing ? The fried rice tasted like white rice with rubber shrimp in it . Worst Chinese ever .	
0	Someone needs to alert corporate . I show up on a Friday 6pm . 3 guys , yes I said 3 guys , are working the bar . Not a tilted Kilt girl can be found behind the bar . So many other options in Pitt for a good bar .	
0	Last night was the second time I tried it , and still have the same problem . 1 . Dough has an uncooked taste 2 . they only have a red sauce for the pizza , and that just leads to much acid in my system . So I will stick to making my own our will stick to dominos who at least uses real Spinach not out of a can ! So gross !	
0	Hugely disappointing . Big fans & frequent customers of the Tatum / Shea location for years . This new concept is a bust . Small portions , limited food options , plastic ware everywhere . Sad to say - we won 't be back .	
1	Delicious ! Great service , yummy food , and fabulous red sangria ! Great atmosphere to go on a date or with a group ! P . S . Try out their breakfast and mimosas ! Perfect way to spend a Saturday morning !	
0	Bad place to watch any game . They play load music while people were trying to watch the World Cup game on TVs that don 't have speakers . We din 't order anything and Ended up going down to Chayo Kitchen & Tequila Bar . There we watched both soccer games with a couple of buckets of Corona light ( have to watch the calories so we can eat and drink more ) .	
1	I ordered the lox omelet which was delicious the only downfall was how massive my plate was that I couldn 't come close to finishing it . The potato spuds were amazing and the pumpkin bread to die for My mom had the Greek omelet and she said it was really great	
1	Great food . Attentive waiters . And they let us just sit and chat for 2 hours after we finished our meal . Didn 't bother us till we actually asked for a bill . Great atmosphere too ! Highly recommend the place .	
0	INCONSISTENT ! Last Saturday was our fifth visit to this Restaurant of Mario ' s . The past four times were great , but this time BOTH pasta dishes we ordered were under cooked , and the Veal Chop was overdone . Very disappointing .	
1	I have been here twice and both times I had a great experience . Front desk was pleasant and quick to get me in . I didn 't have to wait long in the room and doctors/ PAs we 're knowledgeable and caring . Highly recommend .	
1	Omfg . This place was so much fun . Like Japan 's version of willy wonka 's delicious factory . The menu is edible and comes with a dipping sauce . Everything was beyond delicious and the whole place smelled like what I hope heaven smells like . I 'm quite certain I will be going to heaven because I am awesome . Until that day comes , I will be going here . Often .	
1	This place is great . Clean with an open space atmosphere . The friendly staff will walk you through the process of ordering and give you free samples to try . The moist brisket was awesome . It 's fatty meaty goodness didn 't need sauce but i appreciate that its there . Will be back for sure !	
1	THE BEST BURGER IN TOWN , totally love the grill , the breakfast buffet and the Sunday Roast beef is to die for , don 't forget to check out the luscious bakery and fabulous fragrances , gifts and flowers , it is the ULTIMATE in shopping and I love this place ! ! ! !	
1	This place was ok . Nothing bad , just wasn 't as great as its hyped up to be . I will admit that they give a great range of options for the AYCE . The service was great , very friendly . I will try it again maybe during the day next time .	
0	Disaster ! Unbelievably disappointing . I understand they need to make money but after upgrading to a suite and finding out everything is booked solid , no space at the pools , restaurants sold out for tonight iI Feel like I 've been flimflammed ! Will never return !	
1	Only after trying the Bellagio buffet , do I give Wynn Buffet 5 stars . I had high hopes for the Bellagio , but the Wynn outshined them . The Wynn 's had a seemingly larger selection , nicer dining floor area , shorter wait , better service in general . And props for having dungeoness crab legs starting at 4pm . Well worth the price ...	
1	Nice building , good decor . Too busy to find seats at 8 : 00 on a Friday night . Bartender didn 't seem to know much Bout beer but they had a small selection of real ales from the cask .	
1	First time here , really wanted brunch but didn 't realize they only have it on Sundays . Had their local grass fed burger and it was delicious . Full bar with a great draft list and located in a really quaint house style setting .	
1	Last year for my 21st birthday we went to Vegas and after hearing my boyfriend rave about this restraunt for two years , I knew I had to take him here ! Oh he was so very right , it was AMAZING ; definitely a well $ 200 . 00 spent ! I would HIGHLY reccomend this restaurant . PS : You have to try the calamari !	
1	It 's a small place with a large amount of flavor . I 've eaten here twice and loved it both times . The soups are great and full of flavor . Be careful when saying how hot you want it , I tried medium and it had some kick .	
1	Fun atmosphere , best food that we had while here on vacation ( we also ate at Element at Sanctuary , too ) , and our service was amazing ! Thanks , Arrie for making our experience so enjoyable ! We also loved the house band . Great sound and set list !	
1	Kevin has been working with us on our water heater and he is always on time , always nice and definitely knows his business . I can 't believe he hasn 't been reviewed . Definitely the nicest handyman I have ever met and reasonable in pricing	
0	Poor customer service ruined the entire experience . The coffee was about average , the decor was adorable , but the barista 's were so rude that we just took our coffee to go instead of enjoying the ambiance . Won 't be recommending this place to others .	
0	This place is a dump and that is a compliment for the neighborhood it 's located in . If you have a fear of being mugged , shot , or raped then stay away ... and I mean during daylight hours too ! This place makes prison look like Club Med . Too bad I had to chose a star or I would have rated it no stars .	
1	This Subway is great ! Usually you get employees who seem like they 've spent a little too much time in the back smoking pot , but the staff here is always upbeat and friendly . The guy always asks me if I need my sandwich cut or wrapped in any special way . You always get a very well put together sandwich .	
1	This place is awesome ! ! ! Here for the NFR as a vendor and this has been our fav spot ! ! ! Easy , convenient , great service ! ! Waiters and waitresses are the best we have seen in Vegas . .	
1	Great bar ! Great staff ! Definitely my favorite place to get drinks with friends and play pool . Awesome happy hour prices and the bartenders are very good . The crispy chicken salad is to die for . They also have an Internet jukebox making it very easy to create your own environment with your own music .	
0	Ordered steak fajitas which were very tough . Both the side servings of retried beans and rice were bland . Overall there was a lack of favor as it seems their recipes do not allow for some spices . A little cumin in the beans would make a huge difference The rice was the most bland . The quantity was great but this is no trip to flavor town .	
1	Awesome ! Went there , the knew how to say Italian words the right way and not Americanized . Brought home a corned beef sandwich , and the break was still soft and delicious not hard as a rock like others places I 've brought a sandwich home from . Just the right amount of spicy mustard . So good . Highly recommended . Delicious	
1	I love this location . I used to go here at least once a week until I moved across town . Awesome lunch specials , fantastic staff and great food fast . Vegetarian pad thai is my fave , but the house chicken is to die for and the Mongolian beef is good too . : D Plus its in the smiths parking lot so we you can grab a bite before grocery shopping .	
0	Food was disappointing . Hash browns were pre - formed , like the kind you get from McDonalds . I don 't understand how this place has such high marks . Maybe it 's gone downhill recently . I don 't recommend .	
1	Definitely a decent brunch spot . The parking lot is super small , but they offer complimentary valet . I absolutely loved the verde bloody mary ! So delicious . I think I 'll go back just for that ! The food is good too . Not amazing , but definitely really good . I 'd happily go back again anytime !	
1	Excellent food at this out of the way place . Portions very large and fresh . I want to try everything on the menu . Plan to go back every weekend until I 've tried all menu items . Coffee was also delicious and friendly servers	
1	I 'm a vegetarian , but even I still can 't decide when I come to Lo - Lo ' s . The food is just a big juicy heart attack waiting to happen , but by God , if you 're gonna go , go out in style . Love !	
1	The great thing abotu Red Rock is that it 's far enoguh from The Strip to be free of crowds and touristy nonsense . I don 't gamble or anything like that , but I do frequent the movies here and , on occasion , the bowling alley . You can usually count on no crowds here . We walked up to Harry Potter 7 . 0 on opening night and got great seats for four .	
1	I love coming in this place ! The staff that they have is very knowledgeable . If you have a question , someone is always easy to find . You never get the big store run around . They always have the right advice to give as well . I love to be able to spend my money at a local store . I will be back to see them again .	
0	The old hag with the bad wig behind the bar is so unfriendly . She and another old lady who works there stand around and gossip about customers . I was sitting right next to them listening , like two jealous school girls . DUMP ! !	
1	this is a very fast , affordable airport . it has a lot of connections . those things alone make it a good airport in my book . it 's convenient to the strip and downtown . it 's easy to navigate and clean . the giant horny toad sculpture is so much fun to take a picture with .	
0	Do not be fooled this place has very little seafood it 's a Chinese buffet . The crab legs that they offer you have to fight for and they taste old or have been boiled too long . I brought my kids here for a special dinner and was severely disappointed in the quality for the price . Never again .	
1	Had a great time . Great service . Too bad its in Snobdale I mean Scottsdale . Some 60+ old man killed it for me while he was attempting to hit on me in front of his wife and my husband and son . Can 't wait for the Gilbert location to open ( where we live ) to get away from the Scottsdale vide ! ! !	
0	Pros : line moves faster than the other Buffet of Buffets lines we 've been in Cons : the food is nothing special . We came for lunch and dinner since we stayed at PH and were disappointed both times . The food was very ordinary and doesn 't live up to the Vegas Buffets expectations .	
0	Service was great . I ordered the chicken parm which I had at another Olive Garden a week ago and this one was over done and borderline burnt . I would have sent it back but I was in a business meeting .	
0	I 'm sad to say Paisan 's seems to have gone downhill since it moved . The old location in the now - destroyed University Square was cozy with a weird romantic charm ; I have a lot of nice date memories of that place . The new restaurant is pretty bland inside , and the pasta was horribly overcooked the one time we went . Too bad .	
0	Tourist . Trap . My gf and I were suckered in by the Buy one , get one sign . We walked in , were waited on at the bar , and walked out with two yards of alcohol infused slush . I hardly believe the alcohol infused part though . Total waste of money at an inflated price .	
1	This place is perfect ! Somehow , it can accommodate a family setting with children and a typical scottsdale bar hopping crew at the same time ! It has delicious food but the drinks are unbelievable . BEST BLOODY MARY in town ! !	
1	Great neighborhood pub . The neighborhood needed this , it is quite refreshing ! Great atmosphere , nice beers on tap , nice menu . I had the smoked trout , was fantastic . Did not notice and TV ' s , hope they will be showing Habs games !	
1	what a find this place was , had the steak special thats not on the menu someone just told me to ask for it . Really really nice and only seven dollers we called in a few times after that . the true yorkshireman coming out of me . get it darn thee neck . .	
0	I talked to the owner to request a 1 hour donation to deliver a cake for a 4 year old little girl in hospice . The owner was extremely rude and claimed that he gave to charity often and doubted the validity of my story . I would not recommend this place to anyone .	
1	Whenever the craving for Mexican food hits , I go to this Robertos . The food is consistent and the place is pretty clean . I get one of three things : a California burrito , carne asada nachos , or a breakfast burrito . The nachos are massive so my husband and I usually share . Everything is seasoned well and really fulfills my need for a greasy delicious fix .	
0	Went there for a NBA Playoff Game ( Suns vs . Spurs ) about a year ago . It was crowded and there were many drunk dirty boys trying to score - ewwe ! It has the potential to be a nice little - hole-in - the-wall place , but as it stands currently - not so much . Would not recommend this place .	
0	I had an appointment with Molly . I arrived about five minutes early , and was told she 'd be right out . It has now been forty , and she hasn 't come out to say anything ! At this point , I 'm going to go someplace else . Terrible customer service .	
0	Horrible service ! ! This place is all hype . On Christmas Eve , I called in advance and they confirmed they would be open till 4 . We arrived at 3 and they decided to close early and wouldn 't serve us ! ! Anyway , I wanted to try something new but I 'll keep eating at Patati Patata .	
1	No complaints . Greg was our server . He was very professional , upbeat , and very attentive . The customer service ment a lot to me . I will continue to come back and enjoy this wonderful restaurant . Food was delicious , prices were great .	
1	Great Food . Great Drinks . Always somewhat snotty ladies greeting you up front . ( I 'm with my wife , no , I am not being a creep ) otherwise----- I LOVE THIS PLACE ! ! ! ! Have the Ahi Tuna Appetizer- nothing like it anywhere ! Cucumber Martini ! Always great steaks , pasta , everything . Never had bad food here .	
0	If you want burned pizzas , go here . If you want to pay full price for an incomplete order , go here . I wish I could have given them zero stars because even one star is too many !	
1	Food was outrageous . Ed , our bar tender , was the most personable and knowledgeable bar tender I 've ever had . Drinks were fabulous . Order off the menu or just chat with Ed and he 'll make you something special . You must check out this scene !	
0	Food is good ( not amazing or anything ) but just like any other hole in the wall Thai place . This place became trendy and it totally worth going but you will leave thinking that was good but nothing special , then you may be robbed and possibly raped do to the neighborhood this place is in . The service is super slow , they seat way more tables then they can handle per server .	
1	I love this place . I love everything there except the kabsa rice but that 's just me . Burgers are good . They pile on the veggies . Owner is nice . Freshly made food always has my mouth watering .	
0	Slowest people on planet earth . It took forever for every person in every department . The meat department smelled super fishy ... lost the urge to buy cerviche pretty quick . Never again . Ill take my business elsewhere . Just like my 7 year old said while in the check out , these people take forever but they sure know how to talk and talk and talk .	
1	Always excellent ... ! The service and the food is great . The atmosphere smells great . I didn 't need a reservation and i waited 12 minutes ... Not bad ... Great date place . San Genero event was in town and Nora 's was still busy . . ! That is awesome !	
0	We were the only ones in the restaurant on a Sunday night yet each roll we ordered took 20 - 30 minutes to complete . We were also served water straight from the tap and had a very difficult getting ahold of a waiter / waitress . The food was good but I was not impressed with the overall experience .	
0	I came here with some friends , and was utterly disappointed . I ordered the fajitas , and the meat was limited . I had 15 pitas but 8 pieces of meat , a little cup of guacamole , and lots of onions . What is that ? The service was slow , it took 10 minutes for the waiter to collect payment , but took less then a minute to bring the bill .	
0	Don 't come here if you 're in a time crunch . And $ 25 for a mediocre - at-best sandwich and coke ? I don 't care if it is sit down . No thanks . Skip this place .	
0	Terrible service and extremely inattentive waitress that I had to curse out . I left without ordering anything . Manager could also care less . They were both blondes so go figure . I went across the street to Kelly 's where the food , service , and atmosphere was amazing and welcome . The bartender got a $ 30 tip .	
0	Every time I shop here for pool repair parts , I get the wrong part . The chemicals ( chlorine , muriatic acid , etc . ) are not good quality and the place is operated by amatuers / kids .	
0	The pizza sauce tasted like it was made with Tabasco ! New owners . When we told them about how bad the pizza was he said well I will only charge you half price . How about no charge ? ? We both got ill from this pizza . Stay away ! ! !	
1	Great food , great prices , awesome portions . They delivered the food within the window they gave us , super friendly , the delivery guy also brought a 100 count box of tea , stating merry Christmas . From now on this will be the only place I get Chinese food from ...	
0	Was really looking forward to this since I love sandwiches and Tom C . But man I was really disappointed . Maybe it 's cuz I 've had some really really stellar sandwiches but these just felt like there was no love put into them . I got one of the pork one and it was dry and thin . Really a shame .	
1	Amazing seafood restaurant in a casino . Certainly not your typical casino fare . Very friendly staff who was more than willing to answer questions and make recommendations . The seafood steamed pot was so tasty , and reasonably priced . Will definitely be back when I am in Scottsdale .	
0	Poor service inside . No creamer on the bar , and they were put out to provide a good customer experience . No greeting when entering the store , or waiting in line . Store is not very clean .	
1	Live in the Anthem area of Henderson but will drive all the way here for pizza . The only place we found REAL Chicago thin crust pizza . The wrong toppings were put on the first pizza they brought to our table but they remade correctly . Will double check with server when ordering in the future . The 5 stars is for the pizza .	
1	Pretty nice . I was reluctant to go at first but it was totally not disappointment . Menu has a ton of items and most of them somewhat unusual and interesting . We had tandoori chicken pizza and it was pretty Ok , as far as pizzas from this kind of joints go . Salads looked very enticing as well . I think its pretty nice . I like Eugene	
1	Great customer service , fair price , the work was done when they said it would be done and it was done right . Very happy with them , wouldn 't hesitate to use them again and would certainly recommend them .	
1	This library is great ! There are rooms , and rooms filled with books , movies , and CDs ! Plus any books that are available at other libraries not at the library can be requested and delivered to your local library . I actually don 't read a lot but I still love this library . The only problem with this library is that is is hard to find stuff .	
1	Had a great time with bachelor party of six guys ! Rick and Mike took great care of us , and we had two hours of fun for $ 30 each . Only two miles fm the Strip , so easy cab ride .	
0	Ouch ! ! That was one of the most painful pedis ever ! I 'm so sorry for coming in at 5 : 45 but don 't take it out on toesies ! ! It was cheap , but ya get whatcha pay for . Never again ! !	
0	If you love waiting this is the shuttle for you ... Add another 40 minutes to your travels . This shuttle bus is ridiculous waiting and waiting is the game . Don 't patronize this people - not a good start to your Vegas fun	
0	Dont come here . Broth is plain . nothing special . Very poor service . . we forgot to tip and on our way out the door . . the boss and waitress started yelling at us and giving us dirty looks for not tipping ! Very RUDE ! ! ! !	
0	Frite - Alors has a following , although sometimes I wonder why ... The portions are small , the food is meh and the fries - their namesake - are barely decent ... all this for a large price tag and below average service make this a no - go . I would only consider returning if it was for a friend 's birthday and they chose the place . Overrated .	
1	love it here ! the pastries are always excellent and baked fresh at their other site . Its a pretty big place , there are always seats inside and out , which is really nice . The service was great and very friendly . They have really incredible whip on drinks- it has coffee flavor in it , so totally worth the extra calories : )	
1	A little cold in here . They used to have $ 9 . 99 lunch buffet all you can eat was a good deal and good food . I love the stir fried squid dish and Kalbi dish and of course all the kimchi . Staff is better than last time I was here .	
1	Jean - Marc 's is definitely one of the best bakeries in Pittsburgh . I like to stop here after doing some record shopping . Their pastries are out of this world . The kouign aman and creme brulee are my favorites . The prices are great and the staff is very helpful . I 've been to a couple of other French bakeries around the city and none of them compare .	
1	Picked up a couple $ 49 doorbuster nightstands on Black Friday . Really nice units that 'd otherwise be more than $ 100 . They have a lot of great furniture here . I especially like the kids split - level bunk beds and the coffee tables with rising tops .	
1	Lil ' porgies is great , I frequent every other Wednesday with my mentee from the CU one to program . Porgies is fast , you order and your eating . Be sure to get your favorite sauce on the side , I like to eat my fries and pour as I go . Portions are right for a nice price with speedy service . Great for a quick eat .	
1	This place it amazing ! We brought our 22 month son to adventure around and we ALL loved it . There is so much to do , see , and learn here . Our son especially enjoyed putting the scarfs in the air chutes , the car tracks , and the tricycles . I liked the pool noodle forest the most . If you have kids , this is a great place to go on a hot summer afternoon .	
0	This is a shithole . Overrated and gross watery cold food . Horrible rude waiters who don 't care about you if you 're in a large party , because they know they are getting their 18 percent gratuity added in the bill anyways . Good luck on getting a martini refill or any apology .	
1	Have heard about this place but never tried it until yesterday . Very small cafe type but that 's what I liked about it . Has a family owned at home feel to it . Menu has great selection . Was not in the mood for breakfast so had a sandwich it was still very good . I do want to come back and try the breakfast out . Service was friendly and quick . Will be back	
1	all the employees are incredibly helpful and friendly . Awesome soups salads and sandwiches- like panera x1000 . Each entree comes with a chocolate covered strawberry . Italian sodas with flavorings ! Desserts ! A great little lunch spot . Love it here	
1	Oh my god amazing ! Such a great find in Vegas . Delicious cheap food , there for you whenever you could possibly be hungry . The tomato soup is incredible . I will be here often during all of my future Vegas trips .
